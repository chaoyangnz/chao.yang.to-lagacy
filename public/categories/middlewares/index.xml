      <description>Concepts: Domain, Admin Server, Managed Server, Node Manager
In WebLogic, the concepts are clearer and the management function is more intuitive.
 This figure is a typical plan of a WebLogic domain. In it, all the node managers, managed servers, and admin server are seperated JVM processes. It&#39;s worth noticing that machine 3 has two managed server processes.
As mentioned previously, node manager is also a process running on a physical or virtualised machine called Node for responding the management tasks from admin server.</description>
