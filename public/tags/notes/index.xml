      <description>Nearly every web programmer I met says: I know CSS, even someone told me &amp;ldquo;CSS is simple&amp;rdquo;. So they naturally write CSS in their skill set of CV. But wait, just writing several lines of CSS statements does not necessarily mean you are a qualified CSS user. This is the reason why I plan to learn CSS in depth. What I expect is to get a solid knowledge about how to write large scale CSS and understand why it works when layouting or styling.</description>
