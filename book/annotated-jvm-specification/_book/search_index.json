The Structure of the Java Virtual Machine\nThis document specifies an abstract machine. It does not describe any particular implementation of the Java Virtual Machine.\nTo implement the Java Virtual Machine correctly, you need only be able to read theclassfile format and correctly perform the operations specified therein. Implementation details that are not part of the Java Virtual Machine's specification would unnecessarily constrain the creativity of implementors. For example, the memory layout of run-time data areas, the garbage-collection algorithm used, and any internal optimization of the Java Virtual Machine instructions (for example, translating them into machine code) are left to the discretion of the implementor.\nAll references to Unicode in this specification are given with respect to The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0.0, available athttp://www.unicode.org/.\n2.1. TheclassFile Format\nCompiled code to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine is represented using a hardware- and operating system-independent binary format, typically (but not necessarily) stored in a file, known as theclassfile format. Theclassfile format precisely defines the representation of a class or interface, including details such as byte ordering that might be taken for granted in a platform-specific object file format.\nChapter 4, \"TheclassFile Format\", covers theclassfile format in detail.\n2.2. Data Types\nLike the Java programming language, the Java Virtual Machine operates on two kinds of types: primitive types and reference types. There are, correspondingly, two kinds of values that can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, returned by methods, and operated upon: primitive values and reference values.\nThe Java Virtual Machine expects that nearly all type checking is done prior to run time, typically by a compiler, and does not have to be done by the Java Virtual Machine itself. Values of primitive types need not be tagged or otherwise be inspectable to determine their types at run time, or to be distinguished from values of reference types. Instead, the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine distinguishes its operand types using instructions intended to operate on values of specific types. For instance, iadd, ladd, fadd, and dadd are all Java Virtual Machine instructions that add two numeric values and produce numeric results, but each is specialized for its operand type: int,long,float, anddouble, respectively. For a summary of type support in the Java Virtual Machine instruction set, see§2.11.1.\nThe Java Virtual Machine contains explicit support for objects. An object is either a dynamically allocated class instance or an array. A reference to an object is considered to have Java Virtual Machine type reference. Values of type reference can be thought of as pointers to objects. More than one reference to an object may exist. Objects are always operated on, passed, and tested via values of typereference.\n2.3. Primitive Types and Values\nThe primitive data types supported by the Java Virtual Machine are the numeric types, the boolean type (§2.3.4), and the returnAddress type (§2.3.3).\nThe numeric types consist of the integral types (§2.3.1) and the floating-point types (§2.3.2).\nThe integral types are:\n\nbyte, whose values are 8-bit signed two's-complement integers, and whose default value is zero\nshort, whose values are 16-bit signed two's-complement integers, and whose default value is zero\nint, whose values are 32-bit signed two's-complement integers, and whose default value is zero\nlong, whose values are 64-bit signed two's-complement integers, and whose default value is zero\nchar, whose values are 16-bit unsigned integers representing Unicode code points in the Basic Multilingual Plane, encoded with UTF-16, and whose default value is the null code point ('\\u0000')\n\nThe floating-point types are:\n\nfloat, whose values are elements of the float value set or, where supported, the float-extended-exponent value set, and whose default value is positive zero\ndouble, whose values are elements of the double value set or, where supported, the double-extended-exponent value set, and whose default value is positive zero\n\nThe values of the boolean type encode the truth values true and false, and the default value is false.\nThe First Edition of The Java® Virtual Machine Specification did not consider boolean to be a Java Virtual Machine type. However, boolean values do have limited support in the Java Virtual Machine. The Second Edition of The Java® Virtual Machine Specification clarified the issue by treating boolean as a type.\nThe values of the returnAddress type are pointers to the opcodes of Java Virtual Machine instructions. Of the primitive types, only the returnAddress type is not directly associated with a Java programming language type.\n2.3.1. Integral Types and Values\nThe values of the integral types of the Java Virtual Machine are:\n\nFor byte, from -128 to 127 (-27to 27- 1), inclusive\nFor short, from -32768 to 32767 (-215to 215- 1), inclusive\nFor int, from -2147483648 to 2147483647 (-231to 231- 1), inclusive\nFor long, from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 (-263to 263- 1), inclusive\nFor char, from 0 to 65535 inclusive\n\n2.3.2. Floating-Point Types, Value Sets, and Values\nThe floating-point types arefloatanddouble, which are conceptually associated with the 32-bit single-precision and 64-bit double-precision format IEEE 754 values and operations as specified inIEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic(ANSI/IEEE Std. 754-1985, New York).\nThe IEEE 754 standard includes not only positive and negative sign-magnitude numbers, but also positive and negative zeros, positive and negativeinfinities, and a special Not-a-Number value (hereafter abbreviated as \"NaN\"). The NaN value is used to represent the result of certain invalid operations such as dividing zero by zero.\nEvery implementation of the Java Virtual Machine is required to support two standard sets of floating-point values, called thefloat value set_and the_double value set. In addition, an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine may, at its option, support either or both of two extended-exponent floating-point value sets, called thefloat-extended-exponent value set_and the_double-extended-exponent value set. These extended-exponent value sets may, under certain circumstances, be used instead of the standard value sets to represent the values of typefloatordouble.\nThe finite nonzero values of any floating-point value set can all be expressed in the forms⋅m⋅2(e−N+ 1), wheres_is +1 or −1,_m_is a positive integer less than 2_N, ande_is an integer between_Emin= −(2K−1−2) andEmax= 2K−1−1, inclusive, and whereN_and_K_are parameters that depend on the value set. Some values can be represented in this form in more than one way; for example, supposing that a value_v_in a value set might be represented in this form using certain values for_s,m, ande, then if it happened thatm_were even and_e_were less than 2_K-1, one could halvem_and increase_e_by 1 to produce a second representation for the same value_v. A representation in this form is callednormalized_if_m≥2N-1; otherwise the representation is said to bedenormalized. If a value in a value set cannot be represented in such a way thatm≥2N-1, then the value is said to be adenormalized value, because it has no normalized representation.\nThe constraints on the parametersN_and_K(and on the derived parametersEmin_and_Emax) for the two required and two optional floating-point value sets are summarized inTable 2.3.2-A.\nTable 2.3.2-A. Floating-point value set parameters\n\n\n\nParameter\nfloat\nfloat-extended-exponent\ndouble\ndouble-extended-exponent\n\n\n\n\nN\n24\n24\n53\n53\n\n\nK\n8\n≥11\n11\n≥15\n\n\nEmax\n+127\n≥+1023\n+1023\n≥+16383\n\n\nEmin\n-126\n≤-1022\n-1022\n≤-16382\n\n\n\nWhere one or both extended-exponent value sets are supported by an implementation, then for each supported extended-exponent value set there is a specific implementation-dependent constantK, whose value is constrained byTable 2.3.2-A; this valueK_in turn dictates the values for_Emin_and_Emax.\nEach of the four value sets includes not only the finite nonzero values that are ascribed to it above, but also the five values positive zero, negative zero, positive infinity, negative infinity, and NaN.\nNote that the constraints inTable 2.3.2-Aare designed so that every element of the float value set is necessarily also an element of the float-extended-exponent value set, the double value set, and the double-extended-exponent value set. Likewise, each element of the double value set is necessarily also an element of the double-extended-exponent value set. Each extended-exponent value set has a larger range of exponent values than the corresponding standard value set, but does not have more precision.\nThe elements of the float value set are exactly the values that can be represented using the single floating-point format defined in the IEEE 754 standard, except that there is only one NaN value (IEEE 754 specifies 224-2 distinct NaN values). The elements of the double value set are exactly the values that can be represented using the double floating-point format defined in the IEEE 754 standard, except that there is only one NaN value (IEEE 754 specifies 253-2 distinct NaN values). Note, however, that the elements of the float-extended-exponent and double-extended-exponent value sets defined here do_not_correspond to the values that can be represented using IEEE 754 single extended and double extended formats, respectively. This specification does not mandate a specific representation for the values of the floating-point value sets except where floating-point values must be represented in theclassfile format (§4.4.4,§4.4.5).\nThe float, float-extended-exponent, double, and double-extended-exponent value sets are not types. It is always correct for an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine to use an element of the float value set to represent a value of typefloat; however, it may be permissible in certain contexts for an implementation to use an element of the float-extended-exponent value set instead. Similarly, it is always correct for an implementation to use an element of the double value set to represent a value of typedouble; however, it may be permissible in certain contexts for an implementation to use an element of the double-extended-exponent value set instead.\nExcept for NaNs, values of the floating-point value sets areordered. When arranged from smallest to largest, they are negative infinity, negative finite values, positive and negative zero, positive finite values, and positive infinity.\nFloating-point positive zero and floating-point negative zero compare as equal, but there are other operations that can distinguish them; for example, dividing1.0by0.0produces positive infinity, but dividing1.0by-0.0produces negative infinity.\nNaNs areunordered, so numerical comparisons and tests for numerical equality have the valuefalseif either or both of their operands are NaN. In particular, a test for numerical equality of a value against itself has the valuefalseif and only if the value is NaN. A test for numerical inequality has the valuetrueif either operand is NaN.\n2.3.3. ThereturnAddressType and Values\nThereturnAddresstype is used by the Java Virtual Machine'sjsr,ret, andjsr_w_instructions ([§_jsr](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.jsr),[§_ret_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.ret),[§_jsr\\_w_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.jsr_w)\\). The values of thereturnAddresstype are pointers to the opcodes of Java Virtual Machine instructions. Unlike the numeric primitive types, thereturnAddresstype does not correspond to any Java programming language type and cannot be modified by the running program.\n2.3.4. ThebooleanType\nAlthough the Java Virtual Machine defines abooleantype, it only provides very limited support for it. There are no Java Virtual Machine instructions solely dedicated to operations onbooleanvalues. Instead, expressions in the Java programming language that operate onbooleanvalues are compiled to use values of the Java Virtual Machineintdata type.\nThe Java Virtual Machine does directly supportbooleanarrays. Itsnewarray_instruction ([§_newarray](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.newarray)\\) enables creation ofbooleanarrays. Arrays of typebooleanare accessed and modified using thebytearray instructionsbaload_and_bastore(§baload,§bastore).\nIn Oracle’s Java Virtual Machine implementation,booleanarrays in the Java programming language are encoded as Java Virtual Machinebytearrays, using 8 bits perbooleanelement.\nThe Java Virtual Machine encodesbooleanarray components using1to representtrueand0to representfalse. Where Java programming languagebooleanvalues are mapped by compilers to values of Java Virtual Machine typeint, the compilers must use the same encoding.\n2.4. Reference Types and Values\nThere are three kinds ofreferencetypes: class types, array types, and interface types. Their values are references to dynamically created class instances, arrays, or class instances or arrays that implement interfaces, respectively.\nAn array type consists of a_component type_with a single dimension (whose length is not given by the type). The component type of an array type may itself be an array type. If, starting from any array type, one considers its component type, and then (if that is also an array type) the component type of that type, and so on, eventually one must reach a component type that is not an array type; this is called the_element type_of the array type. The element type of an array type is necessarily either a primitive type, or a class type, or an interface type.\nAreferencevalue may also be the special null reference, a reference to no object, which will be denoted here bynull. Thenullreference initially has no run-time type, but may be cast to any type. The default value of areferencetype isnull.\nThis specification does not mandate a concrete value encodingnull.\n2.5. Run-Time Data Areas\nThe Java Virtual Machine defines various run-time data areas that are used during execution of a program. Some of these data areas are created on Java Virtual Machine start-up and are destroyed only when the Java Virtual Machine exits. Other data areas are per thread. Per-thread data areas are created when a thread is created and destroyed when the thread exits.\n2.5.1. ThepcRegister\nThe Java Virtual Machine can support many threads of execution at once (JLS §17). Each Java Virtual Machine thread has its ownpc(program counter) register. At any point, each Java Virtual Machine thread is executing the code of a single method, namely the current method (§2.6) for that thread. If that method is notnative, thepcregister contains the address of the Java Virtual Machine instruction currently being executed. If the method currently being executed by the thread isnative, the value of the Java Virtual Machine'spcregister is undefined. The Java Virtual Machine'spcregister is wide enough to hold areturnAddressor a native pointer on the specific platform.\n2.5.2. Java Virtual Machine Stacks\nEach Java Virtual Machine thread has a privateJava Virtual Machine stack, created at the same time as the thread. A Java Virtual Machine stack stores frames (§2.6). A Java Virtual Machine stack is analogous to the stack of a conventional language such as C: it holds local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return. Because the Java Virtual Machine stack is never manipulated directly except to push and pop frames, frames may be heap allocated. The memory for a Java Virtual Machine stack does not need to be contiguous.\nIn the First Edition ofTheJava® Virtual Machine Specification, the Java Virtual Machine stack was known as theJava stack.\nThis specification permits Java Virtual Machine stacks either to be of a fixed size or to dynamically expand and contract as required by the computation. If the Java Virtual Machine stacks are of a fixed size, the size of each Java Virtual Machine stack may be chosen independently when that stack is created.\nA Java Virtual Machine implementation may provide the programmer or the user control over the initial size of Java Virtual Machine stacks, as well as, in the case of dynamically expanding or contracting Java Virtual Machine stacks, control over the maximum and minimum sizes.\nThe following exceptional conditions are associated with Java Virtual Machine stacks:\n\nIf the computation in a thread requires a larger Java Virtual Machine stack than is permitted, the Java Virtual Machine throws aStackOverflowError.\n\nIf Java Virtual Machine stacks can be dynamically expanded, and expansion is attempted but insufficient memory can be made available to effect the expansion, or if insufficient memory can be made available to create the initial Java Virtual Machine stack for a new thread, the Java Virtual Machine throws anOutOfMemoryError.\n\n\n2.5.3. Heap\nThe Java Virtual Machine has a_heap_that is shared among all Java Virtual Machine threads. The heap is the run-time data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.\nThe heap is created on virtual machine start-up. Heap storage for objects is reclaimed by an automatic storage management system (known as agarbage collector); objects are never explicitly deallocated. The Java Virtual Machine assumes no particular type of automatic storage management system, and the storage management technique may be chosen according to the implementor's system requirements. The heap may be of a fixed size or may be expanded as required by the computation and may be contracted if a larger heap becomes unnecessary. The memory for the heap does not need to be contiguous.\nA Java Virtual Machine implementation may provide the programmer or the user control over the initial size of the heap, as well as, if the heap can be dynamically expanded or contracted, control over the maximum and minimum heap size.\nThe following exceptional condition is associated with the heap:\n\nIf a computation requires more heap than can be made available by the automatic storage management system, the Java Virtual Machine throws anOutOfMemoryError.\n\n2.5.4. Method Area\nThe Java Virtual Machine has a_method area_that is shared among all Java Virtual Machine threads. The method area is analogous to the storage area for compiled code of a conventional language or analogous to the \"text\" segment in an operating system process. It stores per-class structures such as the run-time constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods and constructors, including the special methods (§2.9) used in class and instance initialization and interface initialization.\nThe method area is created on virtual machine start-up. Although the method area is logically part of the heap, simple implementations may choose not to either garbage collect or compact it. This specification does not mandate the location of the method area or the policies used to manage compiled code. The method area may be of a fixed size or may be expanded as required by the computation and may be contracted if a larger method area becomes unnecessary. The memory for the method area does not need to be contiguous.\nA Java Virtual Machine implementation may provide the programmer or the user control over the initial size of the method area, as well as, in the case of a varying-size method area, control over the maximum and minimum method area size.\nThe following exceptional condition is associated with the method area:\n\nIf memory in the method area cannot be made available to satisfy an allocation request, the Java Virtual Machine throws anOutOfMemoryError.\n\n2.5.5. Run-Time Constant Pool\nA_run-time constant pool_is a per-class or per-interface run-time representation of theconstant_pooltable in aclassfile (§4.4). It contains several kinds of constants, ranging from numeric literals known at compile-time to method and field references that must be resolved at run-time. The run-time constant pool serves a function similar to that of a symbol table for a conventional programming language, although it contains a wider range of data than a typical symbol table.\nEach run-time constant pool is allocated from the Java Virtual Machine's method area (§2.5.4). The run-time constant pool for a class or interface is constructed when the class or interface is created (§5.3) by the Java Virtual Machine.\nThe following exceptional condition is associated with the construction of the run-time constant pool for a class or interface:\n\nWhen creating a class or interface, if the construction of the run-time constant pool requires more memory than can be made available in the method area of the Java Virtual Machine, the Java Virtual Machine throws anOutOfMemoryError.\n\nSee§5 (Loading, Linking, and Initializing)for information about the construction of the run-time constant pool.\n2.5.6. Native Method Stacks\nAn implementation of the Java Virtual Machine may use conventional stacks, colloquially called \"C stacks,\" to supportnativemethods (methods written in a language other than the Java programming language). Native method stacks may also be used by the implementation of an interpreter for the Java Virtual Machine's instruction set in a language such as C. Java Virtual Machine implementations that cannot loadnativemethods and that do not themselves rely on conventional stacks need not supply native method stacks. If supplied, native method stacks are typically allocated per thread when each thread is created.\nThis specification permits native method stacks either to be of a fixed size or to dynamically expand and contract as required by the computation. If the native method stacks are of a fixed size, the size of each native method stack may be chosen independently when that stack is created.\nA Java Virtual Machine implementation may provide the programmer or the user control over the initial size of the native method stacks, as well as, in the case of varying-size native method stacks, control over the maximum and minimum method stack sizes.\nThe following exceptional conditions are associated with native method stacks:\n\nIf the computation in a thread requires a larger native method stack than is permitted, the Java Virtual Machine throws aStackOverflowError.\n\nIf native method stacks can be dynamically expanded and native method stack expansion is attempted but insufficient memory can be made available, or if insufficient memory can be made available to create the initial native method stack for a new thread, the Java Virtual Machine throws anOutOfMemoryError.\n\n\n2.6. Frames\nA_frame_is used to store data and partial results, as well as to perform dynamic linking, return values for methods, and dispatch exceptions.\nA new frame is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes, whether that completion is normal or abrupt (it throws an uncaught exception). Frames are allocated from the Java Virtual Machine stack (§2.5.2) of the thread creating the frame. Each frame has its own array of local variables (§2.6.1), its own operand stack (§2.6.2), and a reference to the run-time constant pool (§2.5.5) of the class of the current method.\nA frame may be extended with additional implementation-specific information, such as debugging information.\nThe sizes of the local variable array and the operand stack are determined at compile-time and are supplied along with the code for the method associated with the frame (§4.7.3). Thus the size of the frame data structure depends only on the implementation of the Java Virtual Machine, and the memory for these structures can be allocated simultaneously on method invocation.\nOnly one frame, the frame for the executing method, is active at any point in a given thread of control. This frame is referred to as thecurrent frame, and its method is known as thecurrent method. The class in which the current method is defined is thecurrent class. Operations on local variables and the operand stack are typically with reference to the current frame.\nA frame ceases to be current if its method invokes another method or if its method completes. When a method is invoked, a new frame is created and becomes current when control transfers to the new method. On method return, the current frame passes back the result of its method invocation, if any, to the previous frame. The current frame is then discarded as the previous frame becomes the current one.\nNote that a frame created by a thread is local to that thread and cannot be referenced by any other thread.\n2.6.1. Local Variables\nEach frame (§2.6) contains an array of variables known as itslocal variables. The length of the local variable array of a frame is determined at compile-time and supplied in the binary representation of a class or interface along with the code for the method associated with the frame (§4.7.3).\nA single local variable can hold a value of typeboolean,byte,char,short,int,float,reference, orreturnAddress. A pair of local variables can hold a value of typelongordouble.\nLocal variables are addressed by indexing. The index of the first local variable is zero. An integer is considered to be an index into the local variable array if and only if that integer is between zero and one less than the size of the local variable array.\nA value of typelongor typedoubleoccupies two consecutive local variables. Such a value may only be addressed using the lesser index. For example, a value of typedoublestored in the local variable array at indexn_actually occupies the local variables with indices_n_and_n+1; however, the local variable at indexn+1 cannot be loaded from. It can be stored into. However, doing so invalidates the contents of local variablen.\nThe Java Virtual Machine does not require_n_to be even. In intuitive terms, values of typeslonganddoubleneed not be 64-bit aligned in the local variables array. Implementors are free to decide the appropriate way to represent such values using the two local variables reserved for the value.\nThe Java Virtual Machine uses local variables to pass parameters on method invocation. On class method invocation, any parameters are passed in consecutive local variables starting from local variable0. On instance method invocation, local variable0_is always used to pass a reference to the object on which the instance method is being invoked (thisin the Java programming language). Any parameters are subsequently passed in consecutive local variables starting from local variable_1.\n2.6.2. Operand Stacks\nEach frame (§2.6) contains a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack known as itsoperand stack. The maximum depth of the operand stack of a frame is determined at compile-time and is supplied along with the code for the method associated with the frame (§4.7.3).\nWhere it is clear by context, we will sometimes refer to the operand stack of the current frame as simply the operand stack.\nThe operand stack is empty when the frame that contains it is created. The Java Virtual Machine supplies instructions to load constants or values from local variables or fields onto the operand stack. Other Java Virtual Machine instructions take operands from the operand stack, operate on them, and push the result back onto the operand stack. The operand stack is also used to prepare parameters to be passed to methods and to receive method results.\nFor example, theiadd_instruction ([§_iadd](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.iadd)\\) adds twointvalues together. It requires that theintvalues to be added be the top two values of the operand stack, pushed there by previous instructions. Both of theintvalues are popped from the operand stack. They are added, and their sum is pushed back onto the operand stack. Subcomputations may be nested on the operand stack, resulting in values that can be used by the encompassing computation.\nEach entry on the operand stack can hold a value of any Java Virtual Machine type, including a value of typelongor typedouble.\nValues from the operand stack must be operated upon in ways appropriate to their types. It is not possible, for example, to push twointvalues and subsequently treat them as alongor to push twofloatvalues and subsequently add them with aniadd_instruction. A small number of Java Virtual Machine instructions (the_dup_instructions ([§_dup](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.dup)\\) andswap(§swap)) operate on run-time data areas as raw values without regard to their specific types; these instructions are defined in such a way that they cannot be used to modify or break up individual values. These restrictions on operand stack manipulation are enforced throughclassfile verification (§4.10).\nAt any point in time, an operand stack has an associated depth, where a value of typelongordoublecontributes two units to the depth and a value of any other type contributes one unit.\n2.6.3. Dynamic Linking\nEach frame (§2.6) contains a reference to the run-time constant pool (§2.5.5) for the type of the current method to support_dynamic linking_of the method code. Theclassfile code for a method refers to methods to be invoked and variables to be accessed via symbolic references. Dynamic linking translates these symbolic method references into concrete method references, loading classes as necessary to resolve as-yet-undefined symbols, and translates variable accesses into appropriate offsets in storage structures associated with the run-time location of these variables.\nThis late binding of the methods and variables makes changes in other classes that a method uses less likely to break this code.\n2.6.4. Normal Method Invocation Completion\nA method invocation_completes normally_if that invocation does not cause an exception (§2.10) to be thrown, either directly from the Java Virtual Machine or as a result of executing an explicitthrowstatement. If the invocation of the current method completes normally, then a value may be returned to the invoking method. This occurs when the invoked method executes one of the return instructions (§2.11.8), the choice of which must be appropriate for the type of the value being returned (if any).\nThe current frame (§2.6) is used in this case to restore the state of the invoker, including its local variables and operand stack, with the program counter of the invoker appropriately incremented to skip past the method invocation instruction. Execution then continues normally in the invoking method's frame with the returned value (if any) pushed onto the operand stack of that frame.\n2.6.5. Abrupt Method Invocation Completion\nA method invocationcompletes abruptly_if execution of a Java Virtual Machine instruction within the method causes the Java Virtual Machine to throw an exception (§2.10), and that exception is not handled within the method. Execution of an_athrow_instruction ([§_athrow](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.athrow)\\) also causes an exception to be explicitly thrown and, if the exception is not caught by the current method, results in abrupt method invocation completion. A method invocation that completes abruptly never returns a value to its invoker.\n2.7. Representation of Objects\nThe Java Virtual Machine does not mandate any particular internal structure for objects.\nIn some of Oracle’s implementations of the Java Virtual Machine, a reference to a class instance is a pointer to a_handle_that is itself a pair of pointers: one to a table containing the methods of the object and a pointer to theClassobject that represents the type of the object, and the other to the memory allocated from the heap for the object data.\n2.8. Floating-Point Arithmetic\nThe Java Virtual Machine incorporates a subset of the floating-point arithmetic specified inIEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic(ANSI/IEEE Std. 754-1985, New York).\n2.8.1. Java Virtual Machine Floating-Point Arithmetic and IEEE 754\nThe key differences between the floating-point arithmetic supported by the Java Virtual Machine and the IEEE 754 standard are:\n\nThe floating-point operations of the Java Virtual Machine do not throw exceptions, trap, or otherwise signal the IEEE 754 exceptional conditions of invalid operation, division by zero, overflow, underflow, or inexact. The Java Virtual Machine has no signaling NaN value.\n\nThe Java Virtual Machine does not support IEEE 754 signaling floating-point comparisons.\n\nThe rounding operations of the Java Virtual Machine always use IEEE 754 round to nearest mode. Inexact results are rounded to the nearest representable value, with ties going to the value with a zero least-significant bit. This is the IEEE 754 default mode. But Java Virtual Machine instructions that convert values of floating-point types to values of integral types round toward zero. The Java Virtual Machine does not give any means to change the floating-point rounding mode.\n\nThe Java Virtual Machine does not support either the IEEE 754 single extended or double extended format, except insofar as the double and double-extended-exponent value sets may be said to support the single extended format. The float-extended-exponent and double-extended-exponent value sets, which may optionally be supported, do not correspond to the values of the IEEE 754 extended formats: the IEEE 754 extended formats require extended precision as well as extended exponent range.\n\n\n2.8.2. Floating-Point Modes\nEvery method has afloating-point mode, which is eitherFP-strict_or_not FP-strict. The floating-point mode of a method is determined by the setting of theACC_STRICTflag of theaccess_flagsitem of themethod_infostructure (§4.6) defining the method. A method for which this flag is set is FP-strict; otherwise, the method is not FP-strict.\nNote that this mapping of theACC_STRICTflag implies that methods in classes compiled by a compiler in JDK release 1.1 or earlier are effectively not FP-strict.\nWe will refer to an operand stack as having a given floating-point mode when the method whose invocation created the frame containing the operand stack has that floating-point mode. Similarly, we will refer to a Java Virtual Machine instruction as having a given floating-point mode when the method containing that instruction has that floating-point mode.\nIf a float-extended-exponent value set is supported (§2.3.2), values of typefloaton an operand stack that is not FP-strict may range over that value set except where prohibited by value set conversion (§2.8.3). If a double-extended-exponent value set is supported (§2.3.2), values of typedoubleon an operand stack that is not FP-strict may range over that value set except where prohibited by value set conversion.\nIn all other contexts, whether on the operand stack or elsewhere, and regardless of floating-point mode, floating-point values of typefloatanddoublemay only range over the float value set and double value set, respectively. In particular, class and instance fields, array elements, local variables, and method parameters may only contain values drawn from the standard value sets.\n2.8.3. Value Set Conversion\nAn implementation of the Java Virtual Machine that supports an extended floating-point value set is permitted or required, under specified circumstances, to map a value of the associated floating-point type between the extended and the standard value sets. Such a_value set conversion_is not a type conversion, but a mapping between the value sets associated with the same type.\nWhere value set conversion is indicated, an implementation is permitted to perform one of the following operations on a value:\n\nIf the value is of typefloatand is not an element of the float value set, it maps the value to the nearest element of the float value set.\n\nIf the value is of typedoubleand is not an element of the double value set, it maps the value to the nearest element of the double value set.\n\n\nIn addition, where value set conversion is indicated, certain operations are required:\n\nSuppose execution of a Java Virtual Machine instruction that is not FP-strict causes a value of typefloatto be pushed onto an operand stack that is FP-strict, passed as a parameter, or stored into a local variable, a field, or an element of an array. If the value is not an element of the float value set, it maps the value to the nearest element of the float value set.\n\nSuppose execution of a Java Virtual Machine instruction that is not FP-strict causes a value of typedoubleto be pushed onto an operand stack that is FP-strict, passed as a parameter, or stored into a local variable, a field, or an element of an array. If the value is not an element of the double value set, it maps the value to the nearest element of the double value set.\n\n\nSuch required value set conversions may occur as a result of passing a parameter of a floating-point type during method invocation, includingnativemethod invocation; returning a value of a floating-point type from a method that is not FP-strict to a method that is FP-strict; or storing a value of a floating-point type into a local variable, a field, or an array in a method that is not FP-strict.\nNot all values from an extended-exponent value set can be mapped exactly to a value in the corresponding standard value set. If a value being mapped is too large to be represented exactly (its exponent is greater than that permitted by the standard value set), it is converted to a (positive or negative) infinity of the corresponding type. If a value being mapped is too small to be represented exactly (its exponent is smaller than that permitted by the standard value set), it is rounded to the nearest of a representable denormalized value or zero of the same sign.\nValue set conversion preserves infinities and NaNs and cannot change the sign of the value being converted. Value set conversion has no effect on a value that is not of a floating-point type.\n2.9. Special Methods\nAt the level of the Java Virtual Machine, every constructor written in the Java programming language (JLS §8.8) appears as aninstance initialization method_that has the special name. This name is supplied by a compiler. Because the nameis not a valid identifier, it cannot be used directly in a program written in the Java programming language. Instance initialization methods may be invoked only within the Java Virtual Machine by the_invokespecial_instruction ([§_invokespecial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokespecial)\\), and they may be invoked only on uninitialized class instances. An instance initialization method takes on the access permissions (JLS §6.6) of the constructor from which it was derived.\nA class or interface has at most one_class or interface initialization method_and is initialized (§5.5) by invoking that method. The initialization method of a class or interface has the special name, takes no arguments, and is void (§4.3.3).\nOther methods namedin aclassfile are of no consequence. They are not class or interface initialization methods. They cannot be invoked by any Java Virtual Machine instruction and are never invoked by the Java Virtual Machine itself.\nIn aclassfile whose version number is 51.0 or above, the method must additionally have itsACC_STATICflag (§4.6) set in order to be the class or interface initialization method.\nThis requirement was introduced in Java SE 7. In a class file whose version number is 50.0 or below, a method namedthat is void and takes no arguments is considered the class or interface initialization method regardless of the setting of itsACC_STATICflag.\nThe nameis supplied by a compiler. Because the nameis not a valid identifier, it cannot be used directly in a program written in the Java programming language. Class and interface initialization methods are invoked implicitly by the Java Virtual Machine; they are never invoked directly from any Java Virtual Machine instruction, but are invoked only indirectly as part of the class initialization process.\nA method is_signature polymorphic_if all of the following are true:\n\nIt is declared in thejava.lang.invoke.MethodHandleclass.\n\nIt has a single formal parameter of typeObject[].\n\nIt has a return type ofObject.\n\nIt has theACC_VARARGSandACC_NATIVEflags set.\n\n\nIn Java SE 8, the only signature polymorphic methods are theinvokeandinvokeExactmethods of the classjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandle.\nThe Java Virtual Machine gives special treatment to signature polymorphic methods in theinvokevirtual_instruction ([§_invokevirtual](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokevirtual)\\), in order to effect invocation of amethod handle. A method handle is a strongly typed, directly executable reference to an underlying method, constructor, field, or similar low-level operation (§5.4.3.5), with optional transformations of arguments or return values. These transformations are quite general, and include such patterns as conversion, insertion, deletion, and substitution. See thejava.lang.invokepackage in the Java SE platform API for more information.\n2.10. Exceptions\nAn exception in the Java Virtual Machine is represented by an instance of the classThrowableor one of its subclasses. Throwing an exception results in an immediate nonlocal transfer of control from the point where the exception was thrown.\nMost exceptions occur synchronously as a result of an action by the thread in which they occur. An asynchronous exception, by contrast, can potentially occur at any point in the execution of a program. The Java Virtual Machine throws an exception for one of three reasons:\n\nAnathrow_instruction ([§_athrow](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.athrow)\\) was executed.\n\nAn abnormal execution condition was synchronously detected by the Java Virtual Machine. These exceptions are not thrown at an arbitrary point in the program, but only synchronously after execution of an instruction that either:\n\nSpecifies the exception as a possible result, such as:\n\nWhen the instruction embodies an operation that violates the semantics of the Java programming language, for example indexing outside the bounds of an array.\n\nWhen an error occurs in loading or linking part of the program.\n\n\n\nCauses some limit on a resource to be exceeded, for example when too much memory is used.\n\n\n\nAn asynchronous exception occurred because:\n\nThestopmethod of classThreadorThreadGroupwas invoked, or\n\nAn internal error occurred in the Java Virtual Machine implementation.\n\n\nThestopmethods may be invoked by one thread to affect another thread or all the threads in a specified thread group. They are asynchronous because they may occur at any point in the execution of the other thread or threads. An internal error is considered asynchronous (§6.3).\n\n\nA Java Virtual Machine may permit a small but bounded amount of execution to occur before an asynchronous exception is thrown. This delay is permitted to allow optimized code to detect and throw these exceptions at points where it is practical to handle them while obeying the semantics of the Java programming language.\nA simple implementation might poll for asynchronous exceptions at the point of each control transfer instruction. Since a program has a finite size, this provides a bound on the total delay in detecting an asynchronous exception. Since no asynchronous exception will occur between control transfers, the code generator has some flexibility to reorder computation between control transfers for greater performance. The paperPolling Efficiently on Stock Hardware_by Marc Feeley,_Proc. 1993 Conference on Functional Programming and Computer Architecture, Copenhagen, Denmark, pp. 179–187, is recommended as further reading.\nExceptions thrown by the Java Virtual Machine are precise: when the transfer of control takes place, all effects of the instructions executed before the point from which the exception is thrown must appear to have taken place. No instructions that occur after the point from which the exception is thrown may appear to have been evaluated. If optimized code has speculatively executed some of the instructions which follow the point at which the exception occurs, such code must be prepared to hide this speculative execution from the user-visible state of the program.\nEach method in the Java Virtual Machine may be associated with zero or moreexception handlers. An exception handler specifies the range of offsets into the Java Virtual Machine code implementing the method for which the exception handler is active, describes the type of exception that the exception handler is able to handle, and specifies the location of the code that is to handle that exception. An exception matches an exception handler if the offset of the instruction that caused the exception is in the range of offsets of the exception handler and the exception type is the same class as or a subclass of the class of exception that the exception handler handles. When an exception is thrown, the Java Virtual Machine searches for a matching exception handler in the current method. If a matching exception handler is found, the system branches to the exception handling code specified by the matched handler.\nIf no such exception handler is found in the current method, the current method invocation completes abruptly (§2.6.5). On abrupt completion, the operand stack and local variables of the current method invocation are discarded, and its frame is popped, reinstating the frame of the invoking method. The exception is then rethrown in the context of the invoker's frame and so on, continuing up the method invocation chain. If no suitable exception handler is found before the top of the method invocation chain is reached, the execution of the thread in which the exception was thrown is terminated.\nThe order in which the exception handlers of a method are searched for a match is important. Within aclassfile, the exception handlers for each method are stored in a table (§4.7.3). At run time, when an exception is thrown, the Java Virtual Machine searches the exception handlers of the current method in the order that they appear in the corresponding exception handler table in theclassfile, starting from the beginning of that table.\nNote that the Java Virtual Machine does not enforce nesting of or any ordering of the exception table entries of a method. The exception handling semantics of the Java programming language are implemented only through cooperation with the compiler (§3.12). Whenclassfiles are generated by some other means, the defined search procedure ensures that all Java Virtual Machine implementations will behave consistently.\n2.11. Instruction Set Summary\nA Java Virtual Machine instruction consists of a one-byte_opcode_specifying the operation to be performed, followed by zero or more_operands_supplying arguments or data that are used by the operation. Many instructions have no operands and consist only of an opcode.\nIgnoring exceptions, the inner loop of a Java Virtual Machine interpreter is effectively\ndo {\n    atomically calculate pc and fetch opcode at pc;\n    if (operands) fetch operands;\n    execute the action for the opcode;\n} while (there is more to do);\nThe number and size of the operands are determined by the opcode. If an operand is more than one byte in size, then it is stored inbig-endian_order - high-order byte first. For example, an unsigned 16-bit index into the local variables is stored as two unsigned bytes,_byte1_and_byte2, such that its value is (byte18) |byte2.\nThe bytecode instruction stream is only single-byte aligned. The two exceptions are thelookupswitch_and_tableswitch_instructions ([§_lookupswitch](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.lookupswitch),[§_tableswitch_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.tableswitch)\\), which are padded to force internal alignment of some of their operands on 4-byte boundaries.\nThe decision to limit the Java Virtual Machine opcode to a byte and to forgo data alignment within compiled code reflects a conscious bias in favor of compactness, possibly at the cost of some performance in naive implementations. A one-byte opcode also limits the size of the instruction set. Not assuming data alignment means that immediate data larger than a byte must be constructed from bytes at run time on many machines.\n2.11.1. Types and the Java Virtual Machine\nMost of the instructions in the Java Virtual Machine instruction set encode type information about the operations they perform. For instance, theiload_instruction ([§_iload](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.iload)\\) loads the contents of a local variable, which must be anint, onto the operand stack. Thefload_instruction ([§_fload](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.fload)\\) does the same with afloatvalue. The two instructions may have identical implementations, but have distinct opcodes.\nFor the majority of typed instructions, the instruction type is represented explicitly in the opcode mnemonic by a letter:i_for anintoperation,_l_forlong,_s_forshort,_b_forbyte,_c_forchar,_f_forfloat,_d_fordouble, and_a_forreference. Some instructions for which the type is unambiguous do not have a type letter in their mnemonic. For instance,_arraylength_always operates on an object that is an array. Some instructions, such as_goto, an unconditional control transfer, do not operate on typed operands.\nGiven the Java Virtual Machine's one-byte opcode size, encoding types into opcodes places pressure on the design of its instruction set. If each typed instruction supported all of the Java Virtual Machine's run-time data types, there would be more instructions than could be represented in a byte. Instead, the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine provides a reduced level of type support for certain operations. In other words, the instruction set is intentionally not orthogonal. Separate instructions can be used to convert between unsupported and supported data types as necessary.\nTable 2.11.1-Asummarizes the type support in the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine. A specific instruction, with type information, is built by replacing theT_in the instruction template in the opcode column by the letter in the type column. If the type column for some instruction template and type is blank, then no instruction exists supporting that type of operation. For instance, there is a load instruction for typeint,_iload, but there is no load instruction for typebyte.\nNote that most instructions inTable 2.11.1-Ado not have forms for the integral typesbyte,char, andshort. None have forms for thebooleantype. A compiler encodes loads of literal values of typesbyteandshortusing Java Virtual Machine instructions that sign-extend those values to values of typeintat compile-time or run-time. Loads of literal values of typesbooleanandcharare encoded using instructions that zero-extend the literal to a value of typeintat compile-time or run-time. Likewise, loads from arrays of values of typeboolean,byte,short, andcharare encoded using Java Virtual Machine instructions that sign-extend or zero-extend the values to values of typeint. Thus, most operations on values of actual typesboolean,byte,char, andshortare correctly performed by instructions operating on values of computational typeint.\nTable 2.11.1-A.

Load and Store Instructions\nThe load and store instructions transfer values between the local variables (§2.6.1) and the operand stack (§2.6.2) of a Java Virtual Machine frame (§2.6):\n\nLoad a local variable onto the operand stack:iload,iload\\,_lload,lload\\,_fload,fload\\,_dload,dload\\,_aload,aload\\_.\n\nStore a value from the operand stack into a local variable:istore,istore\\,_lstore,lstore\\,_fstore,fstore\\,_dstore,dstore\\,_astore,astore\\_.\n\nLoad a constant on to the operand stack:bipush,sipush,ldc,ldc_w,ldc2_w,aconst_null,iconst_m1,iconst\\,_lconst\\,_fconst\\,_dconst\\_.\n\nGain access to more local variables using a wider index, or to a larger immediate operand:wide.\n\n\nInstructions that access fields of objects and elements of arrays (§2.11.5) also transfer data to and from the operand stack.\nInstruction mnemonics shown above with trailing letters between angle brackets (for instance,iload\\) denote families of instructions (with members_iload_0,iload_1,iload_2, andiload_3_in the case of_iload\\). Such families of instructions are specializations of an additional generic instruction (_iload) that takes one operand. For the specialized instructions, the operand is implicit and does not need to be stored or fetched. The semantics are otherwise the same (iload_0_means the same thing as_iload_with the operand_0). The letter between the angle brackets specifies the type of the implicit operand for that family of instructions: for, a nonnegative integer; for, anint; for, along; for, afloat; and for, adouble. Forms for typeintare used in many cases to perform operations on values of typebyte,char, andshort(§2.11.1).\nThis notation for instruction families is used throughout this specification.\n2.11.3. Arithmetic Instructions\nThe arithmetic instructions compute a result that is typically a function of two values on the operand stack, pushing the result back on the operand stack. There are two main kinds of arithmetic instructions: those operating on integer values and those operating on floating-point values. Within each of these kinds, the arithmetic instructions are specialized to Java Virtual Machine numeric types. There is no direct support for integer arithmetic on values of thebyte,short, andchartypes (§2.11.1), or for values of thebooleantype; those operations are handled by instructions operating on typeint. Integer and floating-point instructions also differ in their behavior on overflow and divide-by-zero. The arithmetic instructions are as follows:\n\nAdd:iadd,ladd,fadd,dadd.\n\nSubtract:isub,lsub,fsub,dsub.\n\nMultiply:imul,lmul,fmul,dmul.\n\nDivide:idiv,ldiv,fdiv,ddiv.\n\nRemainder:irem,lrem,frem,drem.\n\nNegate:ineg,lneg,fneg,dneg.\n\nShift:ishl,ishr,iushr,lshl,lshr,lushr.\n\nBitwise OR:ior,lor.\n\nBitwise AND:iand,land.\n\nBitwise exclusive OR:ixor,lxor.\n\nLocal variable increment:iinc.\n\nComparison:dcmpg,dcmpl,fcmpg,fcmpl,lcmp.\n\n\nThe semantics of the Java programming language operators on integer and floating-point values (JLS §4.2.2, JLS §4.2.4) are directly supported by the semantics of the Java Virtual Machine instruction set.\nThe Java Virtual Machine does not indicate overflow during operations on integer data types. The only integer operations that can throw an exception are the integer divide instructions (idiv_and_ldiv) and the integer remainder instructions (irem_and_lrem), which throw anArithmeticExceptionif the divisor is zero.\nJava Virtual Machine operations on floating-point numbers behave as specified in IEEE 754. In particular, the Java Virtual Machine requires full support of IEEE 754denormalized_floating-point numbers and_gradual underflow, which make it easier to prove desirable properties of particular numerical algorithms.\nThe Java Virtual Machine requires that floating-point arithmetic behave as if every floating-point operator rounded its floating-point result to the result precision._Inexact_results must be rounded to the representable value nearest to the infinitely precise result; if the two nearest representable values are equally near, the one having a least significant bit of zero is chosen. This is the IEEE 754 standard's default rounding mode, known as_round to nearest_mode.\nThe Java Virtual Machine uses the IEEE 754_round towards zero_mode when converting a floating-point value to an integer. This results in the number being truncated; any bits of the significand that represent the fractional part of the operand value are discarded. Round towards zero mode chooses as its result the type's value closest to, but no greater in magnitude than, the infinitely precise result.\nThe Java Virtual Machine's floating-point operators do not throw run-time exceptions (not to be confused with IEEE 754 floating-point exceptions). An operation that overflows produces a signed infinity, an operation that underflows produces a denormalized value or a signed zero, and an operation that has no mathematically definite result produces NaN. All numeric operations with NaN as an operand produce NaN as a result.\nComparisons on values of typelong(lcmp) perform a signed comparison. Comparisons on values of floating-point types (dcmpg,dcmpl,fcmpg,fcmpl) are performed using IEEE 754 nonsignaling comparisons.\n2.11.4. Type Conversion Instructions\nThe type conversion instructions allow conversion between Java Virtual Machine numeric types. These may be used to implement explicit conversions in user code or to mitigate the lack of orthogonality in the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine.\nThe Java Virtual Machine directly supports the following widening numeric conversions:\n\ninttolong,float, ordouble\n\nlongtofloatordouble\n\nfloattodouble\n\n\nThe widening numeric conversion instructions arei2l,i2f,i2d,l2f,l2d, andf2d. The mnemonics for these opcodes are straightforward given the naming conventions for typed instructions and the punning use of 2 to mean \"to.\" For instance, the_i2d_instruction converts anintvalue to adouble.\nMost widening numeric conversions do not lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value. Indeed, conversions widening frominttolongandinttodoubledo not lose any information at all; the numeric value is preserved exactly. Conversions widening fromfloattodoublethat are FP-strict (§2.8.2) also preserve the numeric value exactly; only such conversions that are not FP-strict may lose information about the overall magnitude of the converted value.\nConversions frominttofloat, or fromlongtofloat, or fromlongtodouble, may loseprecision, that is, may lose some of the least significant bits of the value; the resulting floating-point value is a correctly rounded version of the integer value, using IEEE 754 round to nearest mode.\nDespite the fact that loss of precision may occur, widening numeric conversions never cause the Java Virtual Machine to throw a run-time exception (not to be confused with an IEEE 754 floating-point exception).\nA widening numeric conversion of anintto alongsimply sign-extends the two's-complement representation of theintvalue to fill the wider format. A widening numeric conversion of acharto an integral type zero-extends the representation of thecharvalue to fill the wider format.\nNote that widening numeric conversions do not exist from integral typesbyte,char, andshortto typeint. As noted in§2.11.1, values of typebyte,char, andshortare internally widened to typeint, making these conversions implicit.\nThe Java Virtual Machine also directly supports the following narrowing numeric conversions:\n\ninttobyte,short, orchar\n\nlongtoint\n\nfloattointorlong\n\ndoubletoint,long, orfloat\n\n\nThe narrowing numeric conversion instructions arei2b,i2c,i2s,l2i,f2i,f2l,d2i,d2l, andd2f. A narrowing numeric conversion can result in a value of different sign, a different order of magnitude, or both; it may thereby lose precision.\nA narrowing numeric conversion of anintorlongto an integral typeTsimply discards all but the_n_lowest-order bits, where_n_is the number of bits used to represent typeT. This may cause the resulting value not to have the same sign as the input value.\nIn a narrowing numeric conversion of a floating-point value to an integral typeT, whereTis eitherintorlong, the floating-point value is converted as follows:\n\nIf the floating-point value is NaN, the result of the conversion is anintorlong0.\n\nOtherwise, if the floating-point value is not an infinity, the floating-point value is rounded to an integer value_V_using IEEE 754 round towards zero mode. There are two cases:\n\nIfTislongand this integer value can be represented as along, then the result is thelongvalueV.\n\nIfTis of typeintand this integer value can be represented as anint, then the result is theintvalueV.\n\n\n\nOtherwise:\n\nEither the value must be too small (a negative value of large magnitude or negative infinity), and the result is the smallest representable value of typeintorlong.\n\nOr the value must be too large (a positive value of large magnitude or positive infinity), and the result is the largest representable value of typeintorlong.\n\n\n\n\nA narrowing numeric conversion fromdoubletofloatbehaves in accordance with IEEE 754. The result is correctly rounded using IEEE 754 round to nearest mode. A value too small to be represented as afloatis converted to a positive or negative zero of typefloat; a value too large to be represented as afloatis converted to a positive or negative infinity. AdoubleNaN is always converted to afloatNaN.\nDespite the fact that overflow, underflow, or loss of precision may occur, narrowing conversions among numeric types never cause the Java Virtual Machine to throw a run-time exception (not to be confused with an IEEE 754 floating-point exception).\n2.11.5. Object Creation and Manipulation\nAlthough both class instances and arrays are objects, the Java Virtual Machine creates and manipulates class instances and arrays using distinct sets of instructions:\n\nCreate a new class instance:new.\n\nCreate a new array:newarray,anewarray,multianewarray.\n\nAccess fields of classes (staticfields, known as class variables) and fields of class instances (non-staticfields, known as instance variables):getstatic,putstatic,getfield,putfield.\n\nLoad an array component onto the operand stack:baload,caload,saload,iaload,laload,faload,daload,aaload.\n\nStore a value from the operand stack as an array component:bastore,castore,sastore,iastore,lastore,fastore,dastore,aastore.\n\nGet the length of array:arraylength.\n\nCheck properties of class instances or arrays:instanceof,checkcast.\n\n\n2.11.6. Operand Stack Management Instructions\nA number of instructions are provided for the direct manipulation of the operand stack:pop,pop2,dup,dup2,dup_x1,dup2_x1,dup_x2,dup2_x2,swap.\n2.11.7. Control Transfer Instructions\nThe control transfer instructions conditionally or unconditionally cause the Java Virtual Machine to continue execution with an instruction other than the one following the control transfer instruction. They are:\n\nConditional branch:ifeq,ifne,iflt,ifle,ifgt,ifge,ifnull,ifnonnull,if_icmpeq,if_icmpne,if_icmplt,if_icmple,if_icmpgtif_icmpge,if_acmpeq,if_acmpne.\n\nCompound conditional branch:tableswitch,lookupswitch.\n\nUnconditional branch:goto,goto_w,jsr,jsr_w,ret.\n\n\nThe Java Virtual Machine has distinct sets of instructions that conditionally branch on comparison with data ofintandreferencetypes. It also has distinct conditional branch instructions that test for the null reference and thus it is not required to specify a concrete value fornull(§2.4).\nConditional branches on comparisons between data of typesboolean,byte,char, andshortare performed usingintcomparison instructions (§2.11.1). A conditional branch on a comparison between data of typeslong,float, ordoubleis initiated using an instruction that compares the data and produces anintresult of the comparison (§2.11.3). A subsequentintcomparison instruction tests this result and effects the conditional branch. Because of its emphasis onintcomparisons, the Java Virtual Machine provides a rich complement of conditional branch instructions for typeint.\nAllintconditional control transfer instructions perform signed comparisons.\n2.11.8. Method Invocation and Return Instructions\nThe following five instructions invoke methods:\n\n_invokevirtual_invokes an instance method of an object, dispatching on the (virtual) type of the object. This is the normal method dispatch in the Java programming language.\n\n_invokeinterface_invokes an interface method, searching the methods implemented by the particular run-time object to find the appropriate method.\n\n_invokespecial_invokes an instance method requiring special handling, whether an instance initialization method (§2.9), aprivatemethod, or a superclass method.\n\n_invokestatic_invokes a class (static) method in a named class.\n\n_invokedynamic_invokes the method which is the target of the call site object bound to the_invokedynamic_instruction. The call site object was bound to a specific lexical occurrence of the_invokedynamic_instruction by the Java Virtual Machine as a result of running a bootstrap method before the first execution of the instruction. Therefore, each occurrence of an_invokedynamic_instruction has a unique linkage state, unlike the other instructions which invoke methods.\n\n\nThe method return instructions, which are distinguished by return type, areireturn(used to return values of typeboolean,byte,char,short, orint),lreturn,freturn,dreturn, andareturn. In addition, the_return_instruction is used to return from methods declared to be void, instance initialization methods, and class or interface initialization methods.\n2.11.9. Throwing Exceptions\nAn exception is thrown programmatically using the_athrow_instruction. Exceptions can also be thrown by various Java Virtual Machine instructions if they detect an abnormal condition.\n2.11.10. Synchronization\nThe Java Virtual Machine supports synchronization of both methods and sequences of instructions within a method by a single synchronization construct: themonitor.\nMethod-level synchronization is performed implicitly, as part of method invocation and return (§2.11.8). Asynchronizedmethod is distinguished in the run-time constant pool'smethod_infostructure (§4.6) by theACC_SYNCHRONIZEDflag, which is checked by the method invocation instructions. When invoking a method for whichACC_SYNCHRONIZEDis set, the executing thread enters a monitor, invokes the method itself, and exits the monitor whether the method invocation completes normally or abruptly. During the time the executing thread owns the monitor, no other thread may enter it. If an exception is thrown during invocation of thesynchronizedmethod and thesynchronizedmethod does not handle the exception, the monitor for the method is automatically exited before the exception is rethrown out of thesynchronizedmethod.\nSynchronization of sequences of instructions is typically used to encode thesynchronizedblock of the Java programming language. The Java Virtual Machine supplies the_monitorenter_and_monitorexit_instructions to support such language constructs. Proper implementation ofsynchronizedblocks requires cooperation from a compiler targeting the Java Virtual Machine (§3.14).\n_Structured locking_is the situation when, during a method invocation, every exit on a given monitor matches a preceding entry on that monitor. Since there is no assurance that all code submitted to the Java Virtual Machine will perform structured locking, implementations of the Java Virtual Machine are permitted but not required to enforce both of the following two rules guaranteeing structured locking. Let_T_be a thread and_M_be a monitor. Then:\n\nThe number of monitor entries performed by_T_on_M_during a method invocation must equal the number of monitor exits performed by_T_on_M_during the method invocation whether the method invocation completes normally or abruptly.\n\nAt no point during a method invocation may the number of monitor exits performed by_T_on_M_since the method invocation exceed the number of monitor entries performed by_T_on_M_since the method invocation.\n\n\nNote that the monitor entry and exit automatically performed by the Java Virtual Machine when invoking asynchronizedmethod are considered to occur during the calling method's invocation.\n2.12. Class Libraries\nThe Java Virtual Machine must provide sufficient support for the implementation of the class libraries of the Java SE platform. Some of the classes in these libraries cannot be implemented without the cooperation of the Java Virtual Machine.\nClasses that might require special support from the Java Virtual Machine include those that support:\n\nReflection, such as the classes in the packagejava.lang.reflectand the classClass.\n\nLoading and creation of a class or interface. The most obvious example is the classClassLoader.\n\nLinking and initialization of a class or interface. The example classes cited above fall into this category as well.\n\nSecurity, such as the classes in the packagejava.securityand other classes such asSecurityManager.\n\nMultithreading, such as the classThread.\n\nWeak references, such as the classes in the packagejava.lang.ref.\n\n\nThe list above is meant to be illustrative rather than comprehensive. An exhaustive list of these classes or of the functionality they provide is beyond the scope of this specification. See the specifications of the Java SE platform class libraries for details.\n2.13. Public Design, Private Implementation\nThus far this specification has sketched the public view of the Java Virtual Machine: theclassfile format and the instruction set. These components are vital to the hardware-, operating system-, and implementation-independence of the Java Virtual Machine. The implementor may prefer to think of them as a means to securely communicate fragments of programs between hosts each implementing the Java SE platform, rather than as a blueprint to be followed exactly.\nIt is important to understand where the line between the public design and the private implementation lies. A Java Virtual Machine implementation must be able to readclassfiles and must exactly implement the semantics of the Java Virtual Machine code therein. One way of doing this is to take this document as a specification and to implement that specification literally. But it is also perfectly feasible and desirable for the implementor to modify or optimize the implementation within the constraints of this specification. So long as theclassfile format can be read and the semantics of its code are maintained, the implementor may implement these semantics in any way. What is \"under the hood\" is the implementor's business, as long as the correct external interface is carefully maintained.\nThere are some exceptions: debuggers, profilers, and just-in-time code generators can each require access to elements of the Java Virtual Machine that are normally considered to be “under the hood.” Where appropriate, Oracle works with other Java Virtual Machine implementors and with tool vendors to develop common interfaces to the Java Virtual Machine for use by such tools, and to promote those interfaces across the industry.\nThe implementor can use this flexibility to tailor Java Virtual Machine implementations for high performance, low memory use, or portability. What makes sense in a given implementation depends on the goals of that implementation. The range of implementation options includes the following:\n\nTranslating Java Virtual Machine code at load-time or during execution into the instruction set of another virtual machine.\n\nTranslating Java Virtual Machine code at load-time or during execution into the native instruction set of the host CPU (sometimes referred to asjust-in-time, orJIT, code generation).\n\n\nThe existence of a precisely defined virtual machine and object file format need not significantly restrict the creativity of the implementor. The Java Virtual Machine is designed to support many different implementations, providing new and interesting solutions while retaining compatibility between implementations.\n"},"loading-linking-and-initializing.html":{"url":"loading-linking-and-initializing.html","title":"Loading, Linking, and Initializing","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5. Loading, Linking, and Initializing\nThe Java Virtual Machine dynamically loads, links and initializes classes and interfaces. Loading is the process of finding the binary representation of a class or interface type with a particular name and_creating_a class or interface from that binary representation. Linking is the process of taking a class or interface and combining it into the run-time state of the Java Virtual Machine so that it can be executed. Initialization of a class or interface consists of executing the class or interface initialization method(§2.9).\nIn this chapter,§5.1describes how the Java Virtual Machine derives symbolic references from the binary representation of a class or interface.§5.2explains how the processes of loading, linking, and initialization are first initiated by the Java Virtual Machine.§5.3specifies how binary representations of classes and interfaces are loaded by class loaders and how classes and interfaces are created. Linking is described in§5.4.§5.5details how classes and interfaces are initialized.§5.6introduces the notion of binding native methods. Finally,§5.7describes when a Java Virtual Machine exits.\n5.1. The Run-Time Constant Pool\nThe Java Virtual Machine maintains a per-type constant pool (§2.5.5), a run-time data structure that serves many of the purposes of the symbol table of a conventional programming language implementation.\nTheconstant_pooltable (§4.4) in the binary representation of a class or interface is used to construct the run-time constant pool upon class or interface creation (§5.3). All references in the run-time constant pool are initially symbolic. The symbolic references in the run-time constant pool are derived from structures in the binary representation of the class or interface as follows:\n\nA symbolic reference to a class or interface is derived from aCONSTANT_Class_infostructure (§4.4.1) in the binary representation of a class or interface. Such a reference gives the name of the class or interface in the form returned by theClass.getNamemethod, that is:\n\nFor a nonarray class or an interface, the name is the binary name (§4.2.1) of the class or interface.\n\nFor an array class of_n_dimensions, the name begins with_n_occurrences of the ASCII \"[\" character followed by a representation of the element type:\n\nIf the element type is a primitive type, it is represented by the corresponding field descriptor (§4.3.2).\n\nOtherwise, if the element type is a reference type, it is represented by the ASCII \"L\" character followed by the binary name (§4.2.1) of the element type followed by the ASCII \";\" character.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever this chapter refers to the name of a class or interface, it should be understood to be in the form returned by theClass.getNamemethod.\n\nA symbolic reference to a field of a class or an interface is derived from aCONSTANT_Fieldref_infostructure (§4.4.2) in the binary representation of a class or interface. Such a reference gives the name and descriptor of the field, as well as a symbolic reference to the class or interface in which the field is to be found.\n\nA symbolic reference to a method of a class is derived from aCONSTANT_Methodref_infostructure (§4.4.2) in the binary representation of a class or interface. Such a reference gives the name and descriptor of the method, as well as a symbolic reference to the class in which the method is to be found.\n\nA symbolic reference to a method of an interface is derived from aCONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_infostructure (§4.4.2) in the binary representation of a class or interface. Such a reference gives the name and descriptor of the interface method, as well as a symbolic reference to the interface in which the method is to be found.\n\nA symbolic reference to a method handle is derived from aCONSTANT_MethodHandle_infostructure (§4.4.8) in the binary representation of a class or interface. Such a reference gives a symbolic reference to a field of a class or interface, or a method of a class, or a method of an interface, depending on the kind of the method handle.\n\nA symbolic reference to a method type is derived from aCONSTANT_MethodType_infostructure (§4.4.9) in the binary representation of a class or interface. Such a reference gives a method descriptor (§4.3.3).\n\nA symbolic reference to a_call site specifier_is derived from aCONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_infostructure (§4.4.10) in the binary representation of a class or interface. Such a reference gives:\n\na symbolic reference to a method handle, which will serve as a bootstrap method for aninvokedynamic_instruction ([§_invokedynamic](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokedynamic)\\);\n\na sequence of symbolic references (to classes, method types, and method handles), string literals, and run-time constant values which will serve as_static arguments_to a bootstrap method;\n\na method name and method descriptor.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, certain run-time values which are not symbolic references are derived from items found in theconstant_pooltable:\n\nA string literal is areferenceto an instance of classString, and is derived from aCONSTANT_String_infostructure (§4.4.3) in the binary representation of a class or interface. TheCONSTANT_String_infostructure gives the sequence of Unicode code points constituting the string literal.\nThe Java programming language requires that identical string literals (that is, literals that contain the same sequence of code points) must refer to the same instance of classString(JLS §3.10.5). In addition, if the methodString.internis called on any string, the result is areferenceto the same class instance that would be returned if that string appeared as a literal. Thus, the following expression must have the valuetrue:\n(\"a\" + \"b\" + \"c\").intern() == \"abc\"\nTo derive a string literal, the Java Virtual Machine examines the sequence of code points given by theCONSTANT_String_infostructure.\n\nIf the methodString.internhas previously been called on an instance of classStringcontaining a sequence of Unicode code points identical to that given by theCONSTANT_String_infostructure, then the result of string literal derivation is areferenceto that same instance of classString.\n\nOtherwise, a new instance of classStringis created containing the sequence of Unicode code points given by theCONSTANT_String_infostructure; areferenceto that class instance is the result of string literal derivation. Finally, theinternmethod of the newStringinstance is invoked.\n\n\n\nRun-time constant values are derived fromCONSTANT_Integer_info,CONSTANT_Float_info,CONSTANT_Long_info, orCONSTANT_Double_infostructures (§4.4.4,§4.4.5) in the binary representation of a class or interface.\nNote thatCONSTANT_Float_infostructures represent values in IEEE 754 single format andCONSTANT_Double_infostructures represent values in IEEE 754 double format (§4.4.4,§4.4.5). The run-time constant values derived from these structures must thus be values that can be represented using IEEE 754 single and double formats, respectively.\n\n\nThe remaining structures in theconstant_pooltable of the binary representation of a class or interface - theCONSTANT_NameAndType_infoandCONSTANT_Utf8_infostructures (§4.4.6,§4.4.7) - are only used indirectly when deriving symbolic references to classes, interfaces, methods, fields, method types, and method handles, and when deriving string literals and call site specifiers.\n5.2. Java Virtual Machine Startup\nThe Java Virtual Machine starts up by creating an initial class, which is specified in an implementation-dependent manner, using the bootstrap class loader (§5.3.1). The Java Virtual Machine then links the initial class, initializes it, and invokes thepublicclass methodvoid main(String[]). The invocation of this method drives all further execution. Execution of the Java Virtual Machine instructions constituting themainmethod may cause linking (and consequently creation) of additional classes and interfaces, as well as invocation of additional methods.\nIn an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine, the initial class could be provided as a command line argument. Alternatively, the implementation could provide an initial class that sets up a class loader which in turn loads an application. Other choices of the initial class are possible so long as they are consistent with the specification given in the previous paragraph.\n5.3. Creation and Loading\nCreation of a class or interfaceCdenoted by the nameNconsists of the construction in the method area of the Java Virtual Machine (§2.5.4) of an implementation-specific internal representation ofC. Class or interface creation is triggered by another class or interfaceD, which referencesCthrough its run-time constant pool. Class or interface creation may also be triggered byDinvoking methods in certain Java SE platform class libraries (§2.12) such as reflection.\nIfCis not an array class, it is created by loading a binary representation ofC(§4 (TheclassFile Format)) using a class loader. Array classes do not have an external binary representation; they are created by the Java Virtual Machine rather than by a class loader.\nThere are two kinds of class loaders: the bootstrap class loader supplied by the Java Virtual Machine, and user-defined class loaders. Every user-defined class loader is an instance of a subclass of the abstract classClassLoader. Applications employ user-defined class loaders in order to extend the manner in which the Java Virtual Machine dynamically loads and thereby creates classes. User-defined class loaders can be used to create classes that originate from user-defined sources. For example, a class could be downloaded across a network, generated on the fly, or extracted from an encrypted file.\nA class loaderLmay createCby defining it directly or by delegating to another class loader. IfLcreatesCdirectly, we say thatL_defines_Cor, equivalently, thatLis the_defining loader_ofC.\nWhen one class loader delegates to another class loader, the loader that initiates the loading is not necessarily the same loader that completes the loading and defines the class. IfLcreatesC, either by defining it directly or by delegation, we say thatLinitiates loading ofCor, equivalently, thatLis an_initiating loader_ofC.\nAt run time, a class or interface is determined not by its name alone, but by a pair: its binary name (§4.2.1) and its defining class loader. Each such class or interface belongs to a singlerun-time package. The run-time package of a class or interface is determined by the package name and defining class loader of the class or interface.\nThe Java Virtual Machine uses one of three procedures to create class or interfaceCdenoted byN:\n\nIfNdenotes a nonarray class or an interface, one of the two following methods is used to load and thereby createC:\n\nIfDwas defined by the bootstrap class loader, then the bootstrap class loader initiates loading ofC(§5.3.1).\n\nIfDwas defined by a user-defined class loader, then that same user-defined class loader initiates loading ofC(§5.3.2).\n\n\n\nOtherwiseNdenotes an array class. An array class is created directly by the Java Virtual Machine (§5.3.3), not by a class loader. However, the defining class loader ofDis used in the process of creating array classC.\n\n\nIf an error occurs during class loading, then an instance of a subclass ofLinkageErrormust be thrown at a point in the program that (directly or indirectly) uses the class or interface being loaded.\nIf the Java Virtual Machine ever attempts to load a classCduring verification (§5.4.1) or resolution (§5.4.3) (but not initialization (§5.5)), and the class loader that is used to initiate loading ofCthrows an instance ofClassNotFoundException, then the Java Virtual Machine must throw an instance ofNoClassDefFoundErrorwhose cause is the instance ofClassNotFoundException.\n(A subtlety here is that recursive class loading to load superclasses is performed as part of resolution (§5.3.5, step 3). Therefore, aClassNotFoundExceptionthat results from a class loader failing to load a superclass must be wrapped in aNoClassDefFoundError.)\nA well-behaved class loader should maintain three properties:\n\nGiven the same name, a good class loader should always return the sameClassobject.\n\nIf a class loaderL1delegates loading of a classCto another loaderL2, then for any typeTthat occurs as the direct superclass or a direct superinterface ofC, or as the type of a field inC, or as the type of a formal parameter of a method or constructor inC, or as a return type of a method inC,L1andL2should return the sameClassobject.\n\nIf a user-defined classloader prefetches binary representations of classes and interfaces, or loads a group of related classes together, then it must reflect loading errors only at points in the program where they could have arisen without prefetching or group loading.\n\n\nWe will sometimes represent a class or interface using the notation,Ld>, whereNdenotes the name of the class or interface andLddenotes the defining loader of the class or interface.\nWe will also represent a class or interface using the notationNLi, whereNdenotes the name of the class or interface andLidenotes an initiating loader of the class or interface.\n5.3.1. Loading Using the Bootstrap Class Loader\nThe following steps are used to load and thereby create the nonarray class or interfaceCdenoted byNusing the bootstrap class loader.\nFirst, the Java Virtual Machine determines whether the bootstrap class loader has already been recorded as an initiating loader of a class or interface denoted byN. If so, this class or interface isC, and no class creation is necessary.\nOtherwise, the Java Virtual Machine passes the argumentNto an invocation of a method on the bootstrap class loader to search for a purported representation ofCin a platform-dependent manner. Typically, a class or interface will be represented using a file in a hierarchical file system, and the name of the class or interface will be encoded in the pathname of the file.\nNote that there is no guarantee that a purported representation found is valid or is a representation ofC. This phase of loading must detect the following error:\n\nIf no purported representation ofCis found, loading throws an instance ofClassNotFoundException.\n\nThen the Java Virtual Machine attempts to derive a class denoted byNusing the bootstrap class loader from the purported representation using the algorithm found in§5.3.5. That class isC.\n5.3.2. Loading Using a User-defined Class Loader\nThe following steps are used to load and thereby create the nonarray class or interfaceCdenoted byNusing a user-defined class loaderL.\nFirst, the Java Virtual Machine determines whetherLhas already been recorded as an initiating loader of a class or interface denoted byN. If so, this class or interface isC, and no class creation is necessary.\nOtherwise, the Java Virtual Machine invokesloadClass(N)onL. The value returned by the invocation is the created class or interfaceC. The Java Virtual Machine then records thatLis an initiating loader ofC(§5.3.4). The remainder of this section describes this process in more detail.\nWhen theloadClassmethod of the class loaderLis invoked with the nameNof a class or interfaceCto be loaded,Lmust perform one of the following two operations in order to loadC:\n\nThe class loaderLcan create an array of bytes representingCas the bytes of aClassFilestructure (§4.1); it then must invoke the methoddefineClassof classClassLoader. InvokingdefineClasscauses the Java Virtual Machine to derive a class or interface denoted byNusingLfrom the array of bytes using the algorithm found in§5.3.5.\n\nThe class loaderLcan delegate the loading ofCto some other class loaderL'. This is accomplished by passing the argumentNdirectly or indirectly to an invocation of a method onL' (typically theloadClassmethod). The result of the invocation isC.\n\n\nIn either (1) or (2), if the class loaderLis unable to load a class or interface denoted byNfor any reason, it must throw an instance ofClassNotFoundException.\nSince JDK release 1.1, Oracle’s Java Virtual Machine implementation has invoked theloadClassmethod of a class loader in order to cause it to load a class or interface. The argument toloadClassis the name of the class or interface to be loaded. There is also a two-argument version of theloadClassmethod, where the second argument is abooleanthat indicates whether the class or interface is to be linked or not. Only the two-argument version was supplied in JDK release 1.0.2, and Oracle’s Java Virtual Machine implementation relied on it to link the loaded class or interface. From JDK release 1.1 onward, Oracle’s Java Virtual Machine implementation links the class or interface directly, without relying on the class loader.\n5.3.3. Creating Array Classes\nThe following steps are used to create the array classCdenoted byNusing class loaderL. Class loaderLmay be either the bootstrap class loader or a user-defined class loader.\nIfLhas already been recorded as an initiating loader of an array class with the same component type asN, that class isC, and no array class creation is necessary.\nOtherwise, the following steps are performed to createC:\n\nIf the component type is areferencetype, the algorithm of this section (§5.3) is applied recursively using class loaderLin order to load and thereby create the component type ofC.\n\nThe Java Virtual Machine creates a new array class with the indicated component type and number of dimensions.\nIf the component type is areferencetype,Cis marked as having been defined by the defining class loader of the component type. Otherwise,Cis marked as having been defined by the bootstrap class loader.\nIn any case, the Java Virtual Machine then records thatLis an initiating loader forC(§5.3.4).\nIf the component type is areferencetype, the accessibility of the array class is determined by the accessibility of its component type. Otherwise, the accessibility of the array class ispublic.\n\n\n5.3.4. Loading Constraints\nEnsuring type safe linkage in the presence of class loaders requires special care. It is possible that when two different class loaders initiate loading of a class or interface denoted byN, the nameNmay denote a different class or interface in each loader.\nWhen a class or interfaceC=,L1>makes a symbolic reference to a field or method of another class or interfaceD=,L2>, the symbolic reference includes a descriptor specifying the type of the field, or the return and argument types of the method. It is essential that any type nameNmentioned in the field or method descriptor denote the same class or interface when loaded byL1and when loaded byL2.\nTo ensure this, the Java Virtual Machine imposes_loading constraints_of the formNL1=NL2during preparation (§5.4.2) and resolution (§5.4.3). To enforce these constraints, the Java Virtual Machine will, at certain prescribed times (see§5.3.1,§5.3.2,§5.3.3, and§5.3.5), record that a particular loader is an initiating loader of a particular class. After recording that a loader is an initiating loader of a class, the Java Virtual Machine must immediately check to see if any loading constraints are violated. If so, the record is retracted, the Java Virtual Machine throws aLinkageError, and the loading operation that caused the recording to take place fails.\nSimilarly, after imposing a loading constraint (see§5.4.2,§5.4.3.2,§5.4.3.3, and§5.4.3.4), the Java Virtual Machine must immediately check to see if any loading constraints are violated. If so, the newly imposed loading constraint is retracted, the Java Virtual Machine throws aLinkageError, and the operation that caused the constraint to be imposed (either resolution or preparation, as the case may be) fails.\nThe situations described here are the only times at which the Java Virtual Machine checks whether any loading constraints have been violated. A loading constraint is violated if, and only if, all the following four conditions hold:\n\nThere exists a loaderLsuch thatLhas been recorded by the Java Virtual Machine as an initiating loader of a classCnamedN.\n\nThere exists a loaderL' such thatL' has been recorded by the Java Virtual Machine as an initiating loader of a classC' namedN.\n\nThe equivalence relation defined by the (transitive closure of the) set of imposed constraints impliesNL=NL'.\n\nC≠C'.\n\n\nA full discussion of class loaders and type safety is beyond the scope of this specification. For a more comprehensive discussion, readers are referred toDynamic Class Loading in the Java Virtual Machine_by Sheng Liang and Gilad Bracha (_Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Languages and Applications).\n5.3.5. Deriving a Class from aclassFile Representation\nThe following steps are used to derive aClassobject for the nonarray class or interfaceCdenoted byNusing loaderLfrom a purported representation inclassfile format.\n\nFirst, the Java Virtual Machine determines whether it has already recorded thatLis an initiating loader of a class or interface denoted byN. If so, this creation attempt is invalid and loading throws aLinkageError.\n\nOtherwise, the Java Virtual Machine attempts to parse the purported representation. However, the purported representation may not in fact be a valid representation ofC.\nThis phase of loading must detect the following errors:\n\nIf the purported representation is not aClassFilestructure (§4.1,§4.8), loading throws an instance ofClassFormatError.\n\nOtherwise, if the purported representation is not of a supported major or minor version (§4.1), loading throws an instance ofUnsupportedClassVersionError.\nUnsupportedClassVersionError, a subclass ofClassFormatError, was introduced to enable easy identification of aClassFormatErrorcaused by an attempt to load a class whose representation uses an unsupported version of theclassfile format. In JDK release 1.1 and earlier, an instance ofNoClassDefFoundErrororClassFormatErrorwas thrown in case of an unsupported version, depending on whether the class was being loaded by the system class loader or a user-defined class loader.\n\nOtherwise, if the purported representation does not actually represent a class namedN, loading throws an instance ofNoClassDefFoundErroror an instance of one of its subclasses.\n\n\n\nIfChas a direct superclass, the symbolic reference fromCto its direct superclass is resolved using the algorithm of§5.4.3.1. Note that ifCis an interface it must haveObjectas its direct superclass, which must already have been loaded. OnlyObjecthas no direct superclass.\nAny exceptions that can be thrown due to class or interface resolution can be thrown as a result of this phase of loading. In addition, this phase of loading must detect the following errors:\n\nIf the class or interface named as the direct superclass ofCis in fact an interface, loading throws anIncompatibleClassChangeError.\n\nOtherwise, if any of the superclasses ofCisCitself, loading throws aClassCircularityError.\n\n\n\nIfChas any direct superinterfaces, the symbolic references fromCto its direct superinterfaces are resolved using the algorithm of§5.4.3.1.\nAny exceptions that can be thrown due to class or interface resolution can be thrown as a result of this phase of loading. In addition, this phase of loading must detect the following errors:\n\nIf any of the classes or interfaces named as direct superinterfaces ofCis not in fact an interface, loading throws anIncompatibleClassChangeError.\n\nOtherwise, if any of the superinterfaces ofCisCitself, loading throws aClassCircularityError.\n\n\n\nThe Java Virtual Machine marksCas havingLas its defining class loader and records thatLis an initiating loader ofC(§5.3.4).\n\n\n5.4. Linking\nLinking a class or interface involves verifying and preparing that class or interface, its direct superclass, its direct superinterfaces, and its element type (if it is an array type), if necessary. Resolution of symbolic references in the class or interface is an optional part of linking.\nThis specification allows an implementation flexibility as to when linking activities (and, because of recursion, loading) take place, provided that all of the following properties are maintained:\n\nA class or interface is completely loaded before it is linked.\n\nA class or interface is completely verified and prepared before it is initialized.\n\nErrors detected during linkage are thrown at a point in the program where some action is taken by the program that might, directly or indirectly, require linkage to the class or interface involved in the error.\n\n\nFor example, a Java Virtual Machine implementation may choose to resolve each symbolic reference in a class or interface individually when it is used (\"lazy\" or \"late\" resolution), or to resolve them all at once when the class is being verified (\"eager\" or \"static\" resolution). This means that the resolution process may continue, in some implementations, after a class or interface has been initialized. Whichever strategy is followed, any error detected during resolution must be thrown at a point in the program that (directly or indirectly) uses a symbolic reference to the class or interface.\nBecause linking involves the allocation of new data structures, it may fail with anOutOfMemoryError.\n5.4.1. Verification\nVerification(§4.10) ensures that the binary representation of a class or interface is structurally correct (§4.9). Verification may cause additional classes and interfaces to be loaded (§5.3) but need not cause them to be verified or prepared.\nIf the binary representation of a class or interface does not satisfy the static or structural constraints listed in§4.9, then aVerifyErrormust be thrown at the point in the program that caused the class or interface to be verified.\nIf an attempt by the Java Virtual Machine to verify a class or interface fails because an error is thrown that is an instance ofLinkageError(or a subclass), then subsequent attempts to verify the class or interface always fail with the same error that was thrown as a result of the initial verification attempt.\n5.4.2. Preparation\n_Preparation_involves creating the static fields for a class or interface and initializing such fields to their default values (§2.3,§2.4). This does not require the execution of any Java Virtual Machine code; explicit initializers for static fields are executed as part of initialization (§5.5), not preparation.\nDuring preparation of a class or interfaceC, the Java Virtual Machine also imposes loading constraints (§5.3.4). LetL1be the defining loader ofC. For each methodmdeclared inCthat overrides (§5.4.5) a method declared in a superclass or superinterfaceD,L2>, the Java Virtual Machine imposes the following loading constraints:\nGiven that the return type ofmisTr, and that the formal parameter types ofmareTf1, ...,Tfn, then:\nIfTrnot an array type, letT0beTr; otherwise, letT0be the element type (§2.4) ofTr.\nFori= 1 ton: IfTfiis not an array type, letTibeTfi; otherwise, letTibe the element type (§2.4) ofTfi.\nThenTiL1=TiL2fori= 0 ton.\nFurthermore, ifCimplements a methodmdeclared in a superinterfaceI,L3>ofC, butCdoes not itself declare the methodm, then letD,L2>be the superclass ofCthat declares the implementation of methodminherited byC. The Java Virtual Machine imposes the following constraints:\nGiven that the return type ofmisTr, and that the formal parameter types ofmareTf1, ...,Tfn, then:\nIfTrnot an array type, letT0beTr; otherwise, letT0be the element type (§2.4) ofTr.\nFori= 1 ton: IfTfiis not an array type, letTibeTfi; otherwise, letTibe the element type (§2.4) ofTfi.\nThenTiL2=TiL3fori= 0 ton.\nPreparation may occur at any time following creation but must be completed prior to initialization.\n5.4.3. Resolution\nThe Java Virtual Machine instructionsanewarray,checkcast,getfield,getstatic,instanceof,invokedynamic,invokeinterface,invokespecial,invokestatic,invokevirtual,ldc,ldc_w,multianewarray,new,putfield, and_putstatic_make symbolic references to the run-time constant pool. Execution of any of these instructions requires resolution of its symbolic reference.\n_Resolution_is the process of dynamically determining concrete values from symbolic references in the run-time constant pool.\nResolution of the symbolic reference of one occurrence of an_invokedynamic_instruction_does not_imply that the same symbolic reference is considered resolved for any other_invokedynamic_instruction.\nFor all other instructions above, resolution of the symbolic reference of one occurrence of an instruction_does_imply that the same symbolic reference is considered resolved for any other non-_invokedynamic_instruction.\n(The above text implies that the concrete value determined by resolution for a specific_invokedynamic_instruction is a call site object bound to that specific_invokedynamic_instruction.)\nResolution can be attempted on a symbolic reference that has already been resolved. An attempt to resolve a symbolic reference that has already successfully been resolved always succeeds trivially and always results in the same entity produced by the initial resolution of that reference.\nIf an error occurs during resolution of a symbolic reference, then an instance ofIncompatibleClassChangeError(or a subclass) must be thrown at a point in the program that (directly or indirectly) uses the symbolic reference.\nIf an attempt by the Java Virtual Machine to resolve a symbolic reference fails because an error is thrown that is an instance ofLinkageError(or a subclass), then subsequent attempts to resolve the reference always fail with the same error that was thrown as a result of the initial resolution attempt.\nA symbolic reference to a call site specifier by a specific_invokedynamic_instruction must not be resolved prior to execution of that instruction.\nIn the case of failed resolution of an_invokedynamic_instruction, the bootstrap method is not re-executed on subsequent resolution attempts.\nCertain of the instructions above require additional linking checks when resolving symbolic references. For instance, in order for a_getfield_instruction to successfully resolve the symbolic reference to the field on which it operates, it must not only complete the field resolution steps given in§5.4.3.2but also check that the field is notstatic. If it is astaticfield, a linking exception must be thrown.\nNotably, in order for an_invokedynamic_instruction to successfully resolve the symbolic reference to a call site specifier, the bootstrap method specified therein must complete normally and return a suitable call site object. If the bootstrap method completes abruptly or returns an unsuitable call site object, a linking exception must be thrown.\nLinking exceptions generated by checks that are specific to the execution of a particular Java Virtual Machine instruction are given in the description of that instruction and are not covered in this general discussion of resolution. Note that such exceptions, although described as part of the execution of Java Virtual Machine instructions rather than resolution, are still properly considered failures of resolution.\nThe following sections describe the process of resolving a symbolic reference in the run-time constant pool (§5.1) of a class or interfaceD. Details of resolution differ with the kind of symbolic reference to be resolved.\n5.4.3.1. Class and Interface Resolution\nTo resolve an unresolved symbolic reference fromDto a class or interfaceCdenoted byN, the following steps are performed:\n\nThe defining class loader ofDis used to create a class or interface denoted byN. This class or interface isC. The details of the process are given in§5.3.\nAny exception that can be thrown as a result of failure of class or interface creation can thus be thrown as a result of failure of class and interface resolution.\n\nIfCis an array class and its element type is areferencetype, then a symbolic reference to the class or interface representing the element type is resolved by invoking the algorithm in§5.4.3.1recursively.\n\nFinally, access permissions toCare checked.\n\nIfCis not accessible (§5.4.4) toD, class or interface resolution throws anIllegalAccessError.\nThis condition can occur, for example, ifCis a class that was originally declared to bepublicbut was changed to be non-publicafterDwas compiled.\n\n\n\n\nIf steps 1 and 2 succeed but step 3 fails,Cis still valid and usable. Nevertheless, resolution fails, andDis prohibited from accessingC.\n5.4.3.2. Field Resolution\nTo resolve an unresolved symbolic reference fromDto a field in a class or interfaceC, the symbolic reference toCgiven by the field reference must first be resolved (§5.4.3.1). Therefore, any exception that can be thrown as a result of failure of resolution of a class or interface reference can be thrown as a result of failure of field resolution. If the reference toCcan be successfully resolved, an exception relating to the failure of resolution of the field reference itself can be thrown.\nWhen resolving a field reference, field resolution first attempts to look up the referenced field inCand its superclasses:\n\nIfCdeclares a field with the name and descriptor specified by the field reference, field lookup succeeds. The declared field is the result of the field lookup.\n\nOtherwise, field lookup is applied recursively to the direct superinterfaces of the specified class or interfaceC.\n\nOtherwise, ifChas a superclassS, field lookup is applied recursively toS.\n\nOtherwise, field lookup fails.\n\n\nThen:\n\nIf field lookup fails, field resolution throws aNoSuchFieldError.\n\nOtherwise, if field lookup succeeds but the referenced field is not accessible (§5.4.4) toD, field resolution throws anIllegalAccessError.\n\nOtherwise, letE,L1>be the class or interface in which the referenced field is actually declared and letL2be the defining loader ofD.\nGiven that the type of the referenced field isTf, letTbeTfifTfis not an array type, and letTbe the element type (§2.4) ofTfotherwise.\nThe Java Virtual Machine must impose the loading constraint thatTL1=TL2(§5.3.4).\n\n\n5.4.3.3. Method Resolution\nTo resolve an unresolved symbolic reference fromDto a method in a classC, the symbolic reference toCgiven by the method reference is first resolved (§5.4.3.1). Therefore, any exception that can be thrown as a result of failure of resolution of a class reference can be thrown as a result of failure of method resolution. If the reference toCcan be successfully resolved, exceptions relating to the resolution of the method reference itself can be thrown.\nWhen resolving a method reference:\n\nIfCis an interface, method resolution throws anIncompatibleClassChangeError.\n\nOtherwise, method resolution attempts to locate the referenced method inCand its superclasses:\n\nIfCdeclares exactly one method with the name specified by the method reference, and the declaration is a signature polymorphic method (§2.9), then method lookup succeeds. All the class names mentioned in the descriptor are resolved (§5.4.3.1).\n_The resolved method is the signature polymorphic method declaration._It is not necessary forCto declare a method with the descriptor specified by the method reference.\n\nOtherwise, ifCdeclares a method with the name and descriptor specified by the method reference, method lookup succeeds.\n\nOtherwise, ifChas a superclass, step 2 of method resolution is recursively invoked on the direct superclass ofC.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, method resolution attempts to locate the referenced method in the superinterfaces of the specified classC:\n\nIf the_maximally-specific superinterface methods_ofCfor the name and descriptor specified by the method reference include exactly one method that does not have itsACC_ABSTRACTflag set, then this method is chosen and method lookup succeeds.\n\nOtherwise, if any superinterface ofCdeclares a method with the name and descriptor specified by the method reference that has neither itsACC_PRIVATEflag nor itsACC_STATICflag set, one of these is arbitrarily chosen and method lookup succeeds.\n\nOtherwise, method lookup fails.\n\n\n\n\nA_maximally-specific superinterface method_of a class or interfaceCfor a particular method name and descriptor is any method for which all of the following are true:\n\nThe method is declared in a superinterface (direct or indirect) ofC.\n\nThe method is declared with the specified name and descriptor.\n\nThe method has neither itsACC_PRIVATEflag nor itsACC_STATICflag set.\n\nWhere the method is declared in interfaceI, there exists no other maximally-specific superinterface method ofCwith the specified name and descriptor that is declared in a subinterface ofI.\n\n\nThe result of method resolution is determined by whether method lookup succeeds or fails:\n\nIf method lookup fails, method resolution throws aNoSuchMethodError.\n\nOtherwise, if method lookup succeeds and the referenced method is not accessible (§5.4.4) toD, method resolution throws anIllegalAccessError.\n\nOtherwise, letE,L1>be the class or interface in which the referenced methodmis actually declared, and letL2be the defining loader ofD.\nGiven that the return type ofmisTr, and that the formal parameter types ofmareTf1, ...,Tfn, then:\nIfTris not an array type, letT0beTr; otherwise, letT0be the element type (§2.4) ofTr.\nFori= 1 ton: IfTfiis not an array type, letTibeTfi; otherwise, letTibe the element type (§2.4) ofTfi.\nThe Java Virtual Machine must impose the loading constraintsTiL1=TiL2fori= 0 ton(§5.3.4).\n\n\nWhen resolution searches for a method in the class's superinterfaces, the best outcome is to identify a maximally-specific non-abstractmethod. It is possible that this method will be chosen by method selection, so it is desirable to add class loader constraints for it.\nOtherwise, the result is nondeterministic. This is not new:_TheJava® Virtual Machine Specification_has never identified exactly which method is chosen, and how \"ties\" should be broken. Prior to Java SE 8, this was mostly an unobservable distinction. However, beginning with Java SE 8, the set of interface methods is more heterogenous, so care must be taken to avoid problems with nondeterministic behavior. Thus:\n\nSuperinterface methods that areprivateandstaticare ignored by resolution. This is consistent with the Java programming language, where such interface methods are not inherited.\n\nAny behavior controlled by the resolved method should not depend on whether the method isabstractor not.\n\n\nNote that if the result of resolution is anabstractmethod, the referenced classCmay be non-abstract. RequiringCto beabstractwould conflict with the nondeterministic choice of superinterface methods. Instead, resolution assumes that the run time class of the invoked object has a concrete implementation of the method.\n5.4.3.4. Interface Method Resolution\nTo resolve an unresolved symbolic reference fromDto an interface method in an interfaceC, the symbolic reference toCgiven by the interface method reference is first resolved (§5.4.3.1). Therefore, any exception that can be thrown as a result of failure of resolution of an interface reference can be thrown as a result of failure of interface method resolution. If the reference toCcan be successfully resolved, exceptions relating to the resolution of the interface method reference itself can be thrown.\nWhen resolving an interface method reference:\n\nIfCis not an interface, interface method resolution throws anIncompatibleClassChangeError.\n\nOtherwise, ifCdeclares a method with the name and descriptor specified by the interface method reference, method lookup succeeds.\n\nOtherwise, if the classObjectdeclares a method with the name and descriptor specified by the interface method reference, which has itsACC_PUBLICflag set and does not have itsACC_STATICflag set, method lookup succeeds.\n\nOtherwise, if the maximally-specific superinterface methods (§5.4.3.3) ofCfor the name and descriptor specified by the method reference include exactly one method that does not have itsACC_ABSTRACTflag set, then this method is chosen and method lookup succeeds.\n\nOtherwise, if any superinterface ofCdeclares a method with the name and descriptor specified by the method reference that has neither itsACC_PRIVATEflag nor itsACC_STATICflag set, one of these is arbitrarily chosen and method lookup succeeds.\n\nOtherwise, method lookup fails.\n\n\nThe result of interface method resolution is determined by whether method lookup succeeds or fails:\n\nIf method lookup fails, interface method resolution throws aNoSuchMethodError.\n\nIf method lookup succeeds and the referenced method is not accessible (§5.4.4) toD, interface method resolution throws anIllegalAccessError.\n\nOtherwise, letE,L1>be the class or interface in which the referenced interface methodmis actually declared, and letL2be the defining loader ofD.\nGiven that the return type ofmisTr, and that the formal parameter types ofmareTf1, ...,Tfn, then:\nIfTris not an array type, letT0beTr; otherwise, letT0be the element type (§2.4) ofTr.\nFori= 1 ton: IfTfiis not an array type, letTibeTfi; otherwise, letTibe the element type (§2.4) ofTfi.\nThe Java Virtual Machine must impose the loading constraintsTiL1=TiL2fori= 0 ton(§5.3.4).\n\n\nThe clause about accessibility is necessary because interface method resolution may pick aprivatemethod of interfaceC. (Prior to Java SE 8, the result of interface method resolution could be a non-publicmethod of classObjector astaticmethod of classObject; such results were not consistent with the inheritance model of the Java programming language, and are disallowed in Java SE 8 and above.)\n5.4.3.5. Method Type and Method Handle Resolution\nTo resolve an unresolved symbolic reference to a method type, it is as if resolution occurs of unresolved symbolic references to classes and interfaces (§5.4.3.1) whose names correspond to the types given in the method descriptor (§4.3.3).\nAny exception that can be thrown as a result of failure of resolution of a class reference can thus be thrown as a result of failure of method type resolution.\nThe result of successful method type resolution is areferenceto an instance ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodTypewhich represents the method descriptor.\nMethod type resolution occurs regardless of whether the run time constant pool actually contains symbolic references to classes and interfaces indicated in the method descriptor. Also, the resolution is deemed to occur on_unresolved_symbolic references, so a failure to resolve one method type will not necessarily lead to a later failure to resolve another method type with the same textual method descriptor, if suitable classes and interfaces can be loaded by the later time.\nResolution of an unresolved symbolic reference to a method handle is more complicated. Each method handle resolved by the Java Virtual Machine has an equivalent instruction sequence called itsbytecode behavior, indicated by the method handle'skind. The integer values and descriptions of the nine kinds of method handle are given inTable 5.4.3.5-A.\nSymbolic references by an instruction sequence to fields or methods are indicated byC.x:T, wherexandTare the name and descriptor (§4.3.2,§4.3.3) of the field or method, andCis the class or interface in which the field or method is to be found.\nTable 5.4.3.5-A. Bytecode Behaviors for Method Handles\n\n\n\nKind\nDescription\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n1\nREF_getField\ngetfield C.f:T\n\n\n2\nREF_getStatic\ngetstatic C.f:T\n\n\n3\nREF_putField\nputfield C.f:T\n\n\n4\nREF_putStatic\nputstatic C.f:T\n\n\n5\nREF_invokeVirtual\ninvokevirtual C.m:(A*)T\n\n\n6\nREF_invokeStatic\ninvokestatic C.m:(A*)T\n\n\n7\nREF_invokeSpecial\ninvokespecial C.m:(A*)T\n\n\n8\nREF_newInvokeSpecial\nnew C; dup; invokespecial C.:(A*)V\n\n\n9\nREF_invokeInterface\ninvokeinterface C.m:(A*)T\n\n\n\nLetMHbe the symbolic reference to a method handle (§5.1) being resolved. Then:\n\nLetRbe the symbolic reference to the field or method contained withinMH.\n(Ris derived from theCONSTANT_Fieldref,CONSTANT_Methodref, orCONSTANT_InterfaceMethodrefstructure referred to by thereference_indexitem of theCONSTANT_MethodHandlefrom whichMHis derived.)\n\nLetTbe the type of the field referenced byR, or the return type of the method referenced byR. LetA* be the sequence (perhaps empty) of parameter types of the method referenced byR.\n(TandA* are derived from theCONSTANT_NameAndTypestructure referred to by thename_and_type_indexitem in theCONSTANT_Fieldref,CONSTANT_Methodref, orCONSTANT_InterfaceMethodrefstructure from whichRis derived.)\n\n\nTo resolveMH, all symbolic references to classes, interfaces, fields, and methods inMH's bytecode behavior are resolved, using the following three steps:\n\nFirst,Ris resolved.\n\nSecond, resolution occurs as if of unresolved symbolic references to classes and interfaces whose names correspond to each type inA*, and to the typeT, in that order.\n\nThird, a reference to an instance ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodTypeis obtained as if by resolution of an unresolved symbolic reference to a method type that contains the method descriptor specified inTable 5.4.3.5-Bfor the kind ofMH.\nIt is as if the symbolic reference to a method handle contains a symbolic reference to the method type that the resolved method handle will eventually have. The detailed structure of the method type is obtained by inspectingTable 5.4.3.5-B.\n\n\nIn each step, any exception that can be thrown as a result of failure of resolution of a class or interface or field or method reference can be thrown as a result of failure of method handle resolution.\nThe intent is that resolving a method handle can be done in exactly the same circumstances that the Java Virtual Machine would successfully resolve the symbolic references in the bytecode behavior. In particular, method handles toprivateandprotectedmembers can be created in exactly those classes for which the corresponding normal accesses are legal.\nTable 5.4.3.5-B. Method Descriptors for Method Handles\n\n\n\nKind\nDescription\nMethod descriptor\n\n\n\n\n1\nREF_getField\n(C)T\n\n\n2\nREF_getStatic\n()T\n\n\n3\nREF_putField\n(C,T)V\n\n\n4\nREF_putStatic\n(T)V\n\n\n5\nREF_invokeVirtual\n(C,A*)T\n\n\n6\nREF_invokeStatic\n(A*)T\n\n\n7\nREF_invokeSpecial\n(C,A*)T\n\n\n8\nREF_newInvokeSpecial\n(A*)C\n\n\n9\nREF_invokeInterface\n(C,A*)T\n\n\n\nThe result of successful method handle resolution is areferenceto an instance ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandlewhich represents the method handleMH.\nThe type descriptor of thisjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandleinstance is thejava.lang.invoke.MethodTypeinstance produced in the third step of method handle resolution above.\nThe type descriptor of a method handle is such that a valid call toinvokeExactinjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandleon the method handle has exactly the same stack effects as the bytecode behavior. Calling this method handle on a valid set of arguments has exactly the same effect and returns the same result (if any) as the corresponding bytecode behavior.\nIf the method referenced byRhas theACC_VARARGSflag set (§4.6), then thejava.lang.invoke.MethodHandleinstance is a variable arity method handle; otherwise, it is a fixed arity method handle.\nA variable arity method handle performs argument list boxing (JLS §15.12.4.2) when invoked viainvoke, while its behavior with respect toinvokeExactis as if theACC_VARARGSflag were not set.\nMethod handle resolution throws anIncompatibleClassChangeErrorif the method referenced byRhas theACC_VARARGSflag set and eitherA* is an empty sequence or the last parameter type inA* is not an array type. That is, creation of a variable arity method handle fails.\nAn implementation of the Java Virtual Machine is not required to intern method types or method handles. That is, two distinct symbolic references to method types or method handles which are structurally identical might not resolve to the same instance ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodTypeorjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandlerespectively.\nThejava.lang.invoke.MethodHandlesclass in the Java SE platform API allows creation of method handles with no bytecode behavior. Their behavior is defined by the method ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandlesthat creates them. For example, a method handle may, when invoked, first apply transformations to its argument values, then supply the transformed values to the invocation of another method handle, then apply a transformation to the value returned from that invocation, then return the transformed value as its own result.\n5.4.3.6. Call Site Specifier Resolution\nTo resolve an unresolved symbolic reference to a call site specifier involves three steps:\n\nA call site specifier gives a symbolic reference to a method handle which is to serve as the_bootstrap method_for a dynamic call site (§4.7.23). The method handle is resolved to obtain areferenceto an instance ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandle(§5.4.3.5).\n\nA call site specifier gives a method descriptor,TD. Areferenceto an instance ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodTypeis obtained as if by resolution of a symbolic reference to a method type with the same parameter and return types asTD(§5.4.3.5).\n\nA call site specifier gives zero or morestatic arguments, which communicate application-specific metadata to the bootstrap method. Any static arguments which are symbolic references to classes, method handles, or method types are resolved, as if by invocation of theldc_instruction ([§_ldc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.ldc)\\), to obtainreferences toClassobjects,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandleobjects, andjava.lang.invoke.MethodTypeobjects respectively. Any static arguments that are string literals are used to obtainreferences toStringobjects.\n\n\nThe result of call site specifier resolution is a tuple consisting of:\n\nthereferenceto an instance ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandle,\n\nthereferenceto an instance ofjava.lang.invoke.MethodType,\n\nthereferences to instances ofClass,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle,java.lang.invoke.MethodType, andString.\n\n\nDuring resolution of the symbolic reference to the method handle in the call site specifier, or resolution of the symbolic reference to the method type for the method descriptor in the call site specifier, or resolution of a symbolic reference to any static argument, any of the exceptions pertaining to method type or method handle resolution may be thrown (§5.4.3.5).\n5.4.4. Access Control\nA class or interfaceCis_accessible_to a class or interfaceDif and only if either of the following is true:\n\nCispublic.\n\nCandDare members of the same run-time package (§5.3).\n\n\nA field or methodRis accessible to a class or interfaceDif and only if any of the following is true:\n\nRispublic.\n\nRisprotectedand is declared in a classC, andDis either a subclass ofCorCitself. Furthermore, ifRis notstatic, then the symbolic reference toRmust contain a symbolic reference to a classT, such thatTis either a subclass ofD, a superclass ofD, orDitself.\n\nRis eitherprotectedor has default access (that is, neitherpublicnorprotectednorprivate), and is declared by a class in the same run-time package asD.\n\nRisprivateand is declared inD.\n\n\nThis discussion of access control omits a related restriction on the target of aprotectedfield access or method invocation (the target must be of classDor a subtype ofD). That requirement is checked as part of the verification process (§4.10.1.8); it is not part of link-time access control.\n5.4.5.

Initialization\n_Initialization_of a class or interface consists of executing its class or interface initialization method (§2.9).\nA class or interfaceCmay be initialized only as a result of:\n\nThe execution of any one of the Java Virtual Machine instructionsnew,getstatic,putstatic, orinvokestatic_that referencesC([§_new](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.new),[§_getstatic_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.getstatic),[§_putstatic_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.putstatic),[§_invokestatic_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokestatic)\\). These instructions reference a class or interface directly or indirectly through either a field reference or a method reference.\nUpon execution of a_new_instruction, the referenced class is initialized if it has not been initialized already.\nUpon execution of agetstatic,putstatic, or_invokestatic_instruction, the class or interface that declared the resolved field or method is initialized if it has not been initialized already.\n\nThe first invocation of ajava.lang.invoke.MethodHandleinstance which was the result of method handle resolution (§5.4.3.5) for a method handle of kind 2 (REF_getStatic), 4 (REF_putStatic), 6 (REF_invokeStatic), or 8 (REF_newInvokeSpecial).\nThis implies that the class of a bootstrap method is initialized when the bootstrap method is invoked for aninvokedynamic_instruction ([§_invokedynamic](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokedynamic)\\), as part of the continuing resolution of the call site specifier.\n\nInvocation of certain reflective methods in the class library (§2.12), for example, in classClassor in packagejava.lang.reflect.\n\nIfCis a class, the initialization of one of its subclasses.\n\nIfCis an interface that declares a non-abstract, non-staticmethod, the initialization of a class that implementsCdirectly or indirectly.\n\nIfCis a class, its designation as the initial class at Java Virtual Machine startup (§5.2).\n\n\nPrior to initialization, a class or interface must be linked, that is, verified, prepared, and optionally resolved.\nBecause the Java Virtual Machine is multithreaded, initialization of a class or interface requires careful synchronization, since some other thread may be trying to initialize the same class or interface at the same time. There is also the possibility that initialization of a class or interface may be requested recursively as part of the initialization of that class or interface. The implementation of the Java Virtual Machine is responsible for taking care of synchronization and recursive initialization by using the following procedure. It assumes that theClassobject has already been verified and prepared, and that theClassobject contains state that indicates one of four situations:\n\nThisClassobject is verified and prepared but not initialized.\n\nThisClassobject is being initialized by some particular thread.\n\nThisClassobject is fully initialized and ready for use.\n\nThisClassobject is in an erroneous state, perhaps because initialization was attempted and failed.\n\n\nFor each class or interfaceC, there is a unique initialization lockLC. The mapping fromCtoLCis left to the discretion of the Java Virtual Machine implementation. For example,LCcould be theClassobject forC, or the monitor associated with thatClassobject. The procedure for initializingCis then as follows:\n\nSynchronize on the initialization lock,LC, forC. This involves waiting until the current thread can acquireLC.\n\nIf theClassobject forCindicates that initialization is in progress forCby some other thread, then releaseLCand block the current thread until informed that the in-progress initialization has completed, at which time repeat this procedure.\nThread interrupt status is unaffected by execution of the initialization procedure.\n\nIf theClassobject forCindicates that initialization is in progress forCby the current thread, then this must be a recursive request for initialization. ReleaseLCand complete normally.\n\nIf theClassobject forCindicates thatChas already been initialized, then no further action is required. ReleaseLCand complete normally.\n\nIf theClassobject forCis in an erroneous state, then initialization is not possible. ReleaseLCand throw aNoClassDefFoundError.\n\nOtherwise, record the fact that initialization of theClassobject forCis in progress by the current thread, and releaseLC.\nThen, initialize eachfinalstaticfield ofCwith the constant value in itsConstantValueattribute (§4.7.2), in the order the fields appear in theClassFilestructure.\n\nNext, ifCis a class rather than an interface, and its superclass has not yet been initialized, then letSCbe its superclass and letSI1, ...,SInbe all superinterfaces ofC(whether direct or indirect) that declare at least one non-abstract, non-staticmethod. The order of superinterfaces is given by a recursive enumeration over the superinterface hierarchy of each interface directly implemented byC. For each interfaceIdirectly implemented byC(in the order of theinterfacesarray ofC), the enumeration recurs onI's superinterfaces (in the order of theinterfacesarray ofI) before returningI.\nFor eachSin the list [SC,SI1, ...,SIn], recursively perform this entire procedure forS. If necessary, verify and prepareSfirst.\nIf the initialization ofScompletes abruptly because of a thrown exception, then acquireLC, label theClassobject forCas erroneous, notify all waiting threads, releaseLC, and complete abruptly, throwing the same exception that resulted from initializingSC.\n\nNext, determine whether assertions are enabled forCby querying its defining class loader.\n\nNext, execute the class or interface initialization method ofC.\n\nIf the execution of the class or interface initialization method completes normally, then acquireLC, label theClassobject forCas fully initialized, notify all waiting threads, releaseLC, and complete this procedure normally.\n\nOtherwise, the class or interface initialization method must have completed abruptly by throwing some exceptionE. If the class ofEis notErroror one of its subclasses, then create a new instance of the classExceptionInInitializerErrorwithEas the argument, and use this object in place ofEin the following step. If a new instance ofExceptionInInitializerErrorcannot be created because anOutOfMemoryErroroccurs, then use anOutOfMemoryErrorobject in place ofEin the following step.\n\nAcquireLC, label theClassobject forCas erroneous, notify all waiting threads, releaseLC, and complete this procedure abruptly with reasonEor its replacement as determined in the previous step.\n\n\nA Java Virtual Machine implementation may optimize this procedure by eliding the lock acquisition in step 1 (and release in step 4/5) when it can determine that the initialization of the class has already completed, provided that, in terms of the Java memory model, all_happens-before_orderings (JLS §17.4.5) that would exist if the lock were acquired, still exist when the optimization is performed.\n5.6. Binding Native Method Implementations\n_Binding_is the process by which a function written in a language other than the Java programming language and implementing anativemethod is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine so that it can be executed. Although this process is traditionally referred to as linking, the term binding is used in the specification to avoid confusion with linking of classes or interfaces by the Java Virtual Machine.\n5.7. Java Virtual Machine Exit\nThe Java Virtual Machine exits when some thread invokes theexitmethod of classRuntimeor classSystem, or thehaltmethod of classRuntime, and theexitorhaltoperation is permitted by the security manager.\nIn addition, the JNI (Java Native Interface) Specification describes termination of the Java Virtual Machine when the JNI Invocation API is used to load and unload the Java Virtual Machine.\n"}}}
