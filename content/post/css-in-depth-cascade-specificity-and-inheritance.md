Nearly every web programmer I met says: I know CSS, even someone told me "CSS is simple". So they naturally write CSS in their skill set of CV. But wait, just writing several lines of CSS statements does not necessarily mean you are a qualified CSS user. This is the reason why I plan to learn CSS in depth. What I expect is to get a solid knowledge about how to write large scale CSS and understand why it works when layouting or styling.

# Cascade, specificity and inheritance
**terminology**
A *declaration* includes a property and a value: `color: black;`
A ruleset includes a *selector* and a `declaration block` which contains a group of `declarations`.

```css
body {
  color: black;
  font-family: Helvetcia;
}
```

## cascade
The cascade is the name for this set of rules. It determines how conflicts are resolved, and it’s a fundamental part of how the language works. 

When declarations conflict, the cascade considers three things to resolve the difference:

* Stylesheet origin—Where the styles come from. Your styles are applied in conjunction with the browser’s default styles.
* Selector specificity—Which selectors take precedence over which.
* Source order — Order in which styles are declared in the stylesheet.

### origin

There are different types, or origins, of stylesheets. Yours are called author styles; there are also user agent styles, which are the browser’s default styles. Your styles will always override the user agent styles because the origins are different.

> `!important` is used to raise a declaration to a higher-priority origin.

### specificity

**inline style**
Inline styles have no selector because they are applied directly to the element they target.
Inline declarations will override any declarations applied from your stylesheet or a `<style>` tag.
To override inline declarations in your stylesheet, you’ll need to add an `!important` to the declaration, shifting it into a higher-priority origin.

**selector specificity**
The exact rules of selector specificity are:

- If a selector has more IDs, it wins (that is, it’s more specific).
- If that results in a tie, the selector with the most classes wins.
- If that results in a tie, the selector with the most tag names wins.

> Pseudo-class selectors (e.g, `:hover`) and attribute selectors (e.g, `[type="input"]`) each have the same specificity as a class selector. The universal selector (`*`) and combinators (`>`, `+`, `~`) have no effect on specificity.

*Pitfalls*: Many times developers write selectors using IDs, without realizing this creates a higher specificity, one that is hard to override later. If you need to override a style applied using an ID, you have to use another ID.

### source order

If the origin and the specificity are the same, then the declaration that appears later in the stylesheet — or appears in a stylesheet included later on the page — takes precedence.

## inheritance

If an element has no cascaded value for a given property, it may inherit one from an ancestor element.

Not all properties are inherited, however.

Primarily properties pertaining to text: 

- `color`
- `font`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-variant`, `font-style`
- `line-height`, `letter-spacing`
- `text-align`, `text-indent`, `text-transform`
- `white-space`, `word-spacing`

List properties:

- `list-style`, `list-style-type`, `list-style-position`, `list-style-image`

Table border properties:

- `border-collapse`, `border-spacing`

## special values

Two special values which can be applied to any property: `inherit` and `initial`.

### `inherit`

* use inheritance to take place when a cascaded value is preventing it.
* force inheritance of a property not normally inherited, such as border or padding.

### `initial`

* reset a property to its default value to undo styles

> `initial` vs. `auto`: Sometimes, you can use the value `auto` do the same thing with `initial`, that's because some properties' default value is `auto`. But `auto` isn't the default value for all properties.

> `display: initial` always reset to `display: inline` regardless of what type of element. Because `initial` only resets the default value of property, **NOT** the element.


## shorthand properties

Most shorthand properties let you omit certain values and only specify the bits you’re concerned with. It’s important to know, however, that doing this still sets the omitted values; they’ll be set implicitly to their **initial** value.

**order of shorthand values**

- top, right, bottom, left: `margin`, `padding`
- horizontal, vertical: `background-position`, `box-shadow`, `text-shadow`

# Box model

## default box model

![](/media/15203293881491.jpg)

It includes 3 boxes:

- content box
- padding box
- border box

Margins don't belong to these boxes.

> **background extend to *border box* by default**

```html
<div>
test
</div>
```

```css
div {
margin: 20px;
padding: 20px;
border: 20px solid rgba(0,0,0, 0.5);
background-color: #0000FF;
}
```
This can be changed by `background-clip` property:
- `background-clip: border-box;`
- `background-clip: padding-box;`
- `background-clip: content-box;`

> * Box heights don't observe percentage lengths; box height always adopts the height of the box content, unless a specific absolute height is set (e.g. pixels or ems.)
> * Borders ignore percentage width settings too.
> * tweak the box model with `box-sizing: border-box`

**Normal box model**

**Tweaked with `box-sizing: border-box`**

## Positoning

- `position: static` the default position in the normal document flow. You cannot set `top/bottom/lef/right` properties.
- `position: relative` sets a scope for an element which will layout relative to it original position.
- `positon: absolute` makes the element out of the normal document flow which means it looks non-existent for its surrounding elements. It is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor with `position: relative/absolute`, otherwise relative to  the **viewport**.
- `position: fixed` relative to the **viewport**.


## difficulties with element width

By default, `width` and `height` is for the content box. So it is hard to align two columns sometimes.

To avoid magic number when layout, a solution is use the `calc()` function to reduce the width by exactly that much.

### adjusting the box model

By setting `box-sizing: border-box`, the box model is adjusted.

#### universal fix for border-box sizing

```css
*, ::before, ::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
 }
 ```
 
 More robust fix when using 3rd-party libraries.
 
 ```css
 :root {
    box-sizing: border-box;
 }
  
 *,
 ::before,
 ::after {
    box-sizing: inherit;
 }
 ```
 
### adding a gutter between columns
 
A easy way is to add a percentage margin. But the gutter's width is based on the outer container's width. An em-based gutter is preferred: use `calc()` function.

```css
.sidebar {
  width: calc(30% - 1.5em);
  margin-left: 1.5em;
}
```
 
## difficulties with element height

Typically, it is best to avoid setting explicit height, because normal document flow is designed to work with a constrained width and an unlimited height. Contents fill the width of the viewport and then line wrap as necessary. Because of this, the height of a container is organically determined by its contents, not by the container itself.

> `height` property don't support percentage value. Never ~~`height: 100%`~~.

When you explicitly set an element height, you run the risk of its contents *overflowing* the container.

**`overflow`, `overflow-x`, `overflow-y`**

- `visible`
- `hidden`
- `scroll`
- `auto`

### alternatives to percentage-based heights

Specifying height using a percentage is problematic. For percentage-based" heights to work, the parent must have an explicitly defined height.

**Columns of equal height**

`display: table` rescues this difficulty.

```css
.container {
    display: table;
    width: 100%;
 }
  
 .main {
    display: table-cell;
    width: 70%;
    background-color: #fff;
    border-radius: .5em;
 }
  
 .sidebar {
    display: table-cell;
    width: 30%;
    margin-left: 1.5em;
    padding: 1.5em;
    background-color: #fff;
    border-radius: .5em;
 }
 ```

# Units / Relative Units

## absolute units

- pixel: `px`
- point: `pt`, `pc`
- others: `mm`, `cm`, `inch`

## Ems and rems

### em

`em` is ideal for `padding`, `margin`, `border-radius`

If using `em` for `font-size`, there is a bit tricky, because `em` in `font-size` is computed based on `inherited` font size, which can cause *the shrinking font problem*.

```css
ul {
    font-size: .8em;
}
```
![](/media/15206441532184.jpg)

### rem

> Pseudo-class selector `:root` is equivalent to using the type selector `html`. The `<html>` element is the top-level (or root) node of DOM.

`rem` is short for root `em`. `rem` is well suited for font sizes: `font-size`.

### viewport-relative units

> *viewport* — The framed area in the browser window where the web page is visible. This excludes the browser’s address bar, toolbars, and status bar, if present.

- `vh`: 1/100th of the viewport height
- `vw`: 1/100th of the viewport width
- `vmin`: 1/100th of the smaller dimension, height or width
- `vmax`: 1/100th of the larger dimension, height or width

`vh` is well suited to specify element heights or widths.

```css
:root {
    font-size: calc(.5em + 1vw);
}
```
