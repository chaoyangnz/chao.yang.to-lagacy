I am a Java Developer with over 8 years enterprise-level application development experience. Low key, pragmatic, skeptical, and probably not as smart as I think I am. He/ him. I love peaceful life; reading; travelling; writing; studying history; and getting jealous of people who can sing, dance, or paint.

I have learned a lot since I've started blogging, so I might contradict views I've previously expressed. I always reserve the right to change my mind, so don't be surprised if I do.
