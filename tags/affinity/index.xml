      <description>I do not forget the time when I produced a Flash animation in my university and I also had a dream to design a 3D game on my own.
So now I have some time to realize my dream and start a learning plan. I bought Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer which are great applications and I am pretty obsessed with these two.
I also learn how to program with Unity and 3D model with Maya.</description>
