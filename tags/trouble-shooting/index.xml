      <description>Recent days, I encountered a problem about video loading and quicktime Basic Auth.
In our customer&amp;rsquo;s system, when they used older version Safari (say, 8.0.5) and opened a page for video playing, an authorization window popped up for username and password.
I captured the HTTP massage by using Charles proxy on my Mac OSX. I found in Safari 8.0.5, it always sent 2 requests, one from Safari itself and another from Quicktime plugin which was obviously observed from the User-Agent header.</description>
