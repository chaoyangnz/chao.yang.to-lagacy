# template synatax

property binding

interpolate
```html
<a href="{{url}}">..</a>
```

will be converted to property binding
```html
<a [href]="url">..</a>
```

For some case when a native DOM element has no property, like `<td colspan="">`
td only has colspan attribute, but no respondent colspan property

remember, attribute can only hold string value

So this is the case we need attribute binding

```html
<td [attr.colspan]="col">
```

if you write:
```html
<td colspan="{{col}}">
```
an error will appear:
```text
Template parse errors:
Can't bind to 'colspan' since it isn't a known native property
```
